Sole Proprietorships
The Role of Sole Proprietorships
The easiest business to set up is the one in which you are the only
owner. In this section, you will learn that being your own boss has
its advantages as well as its disadvantages.
A sole proprietorship is a business owned and managed
by a single individual. In this type of business organization,
which is the ownership structure of a company or firm, the lone
entrepreneur earns all of the firm’s profits and is responsible for
all of its debts. This type of company is by far the most popular
in the United States. According to the Internal Revenue Service,
more than 70 percent of all businesses are organized as sole
proprietorships.
Most sole proprietorships are small, however. All together, they
generate only about 4 percent of all sales in the United States.
Many types of businesses can flourish as sole proprietorships.
Look around your neighborhood or town. It is more likely than
not that your local bakery, your barber shop or hair salon,
your bike-repair shop, and the corner grocery store are all sole
proprietorships.
Entrepreneurial Spirit In some ways, the word spiritin the term
entrepreneurial spirit says it all. There is a difference between

To be successful, sole proprietors have to be risk takers. They have to be willing to risk failure for greater satisfaction, and perhaps greater financial gain. The profile of an entrepreneur includes other essential qualities. The person hoping to start a business has to be able to answer “yes” to a series of questions. Are you organized? Are you responsible? Are you energetic? Are you goal-oriented? Do you know how to run a business? You may be the best cook in the world, but if you know nothing about the business end of running a restaurant, you are likely to fail. Steve Case, co-founder of America Online, is a model of the successful entrepreneur who believed in himself and had the vision that a company could thrive on the Internet. If you&apos;re doing something new, you&apos;ve got to have a vision. You&apos;ve got to have a perspective. You&apos;ve got to have some North Star you&apos;re aiming for, and you just believe somehow you&apos;ll get there . . . . You&apos;ve got to stick with it, because these things are not overnight successes . . . . &ndash;from an interview with Academy of Achievement, July 12, 2004 Even though sole proprietorships can be started with an idea and a lot of determination, small business owners are taking on a number of economic responsibilities. If you have employees besides yourself, you&apos;ll need to pay them. You are responsible for making this payroll. By the same token, you are economically responsible for paying your bills. You will likely have rent and utilities to cover. Small businesses benefit from government services just like individuals. Therefore, a small business has an economic responsibility to pay taxes to the government, just as individuals do. Small businesses with employees must also pay employment taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes and federal unemployment taxes.

The owner of a food truck must be licensed to sell food and must submit to inspections to ensure that safety guidelines are followed. >> The Small Business Administration provides support for small businesses. Sole proprietors may have access to loans, grants, and training courses on different aspects of running a business. Advantages of Sole Proprietorships While you need to do more than just hang out a sign to start your own business, a sole proprietorship is simple to establish. It also offers the owner several advantages. Easy to Start and End Easy start-up is the main advantage of the sole proprietorship. With just a small amount of paperwork and legal expense, just about anyone can start such a business. The exact requirements vary from city to city and state to state. Typically, though, sole proprietors must meet the following minimum requirements: Authorization Many sole proprietors must obtain a business license, which is an authorization from the local government to operate a business. Certain professionals, such as doctors and day-care providers, may also need a special license from the state. Site permit If not operating the business out of his or her home, a sole proprietor must obtain a certificate of occupancy to use another building for business. Some zoning laws prohibit doing business in a residential area. Name If not using his or her own name as the name of the business, a sole proprietor must register a business name. This paperwork often takes only a day or two to complete. Because they require little legal paperwork, sole proprietorships are usually the least expensive form of ownership to establish. The federal government offers aid to entrepreneurs to help their businesses grow. Once a business has been started, the federal government&apos;s Small Business Administration provides a variety of loan programs and other support. When you start a small business like a sole proprietorship, you have economic rights. The economic rights of small businesses are protected by laws and regulations that allow businesses to open and operate freely. These economic rights include the right to purchase property, sell products and services at the prices you set, and have equal opportunities in the economy. Relatively Few Regulations A sole proprietorship is the least-regulated form of business organization. Even the smallest business, however, is subject to some regulation, especially industry-specific rules. For example, a soft pretzel stand would be subject to health codes, and a furniture refinishing business would have to follow laws about disposing of dangerous chemicals.178 TOPIC 5 Business and Labor  ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="245"> <text><![CDATA[ Sole proprietorships may also be subject to local zoning laws. Cities and towns often designate certain areas, or zones, for residential use and for business. Zoning laws may prohibit sole proprietors from operating businesses out of their homes. Sole Receiver of Profit A major advantage of the sole proprietorship is that the owner gets to keep all profits after paying income taxes. If the business succeeds, the owner does not have to share the success with anyone else. The desire for profits motivates many people to start their own businesses. Full Control Another advantage of sole proprietorship is that sole proprietors can run their businesses as they wish. This high degree of freedom appeals to entrepreneurs. Fast, flexible decision making allows sole proprietors to take full advantage of sudden opportunities. These entrepreneurs can respond quickly to changes in the marketplace. Finally, if sole proprietors decide to stop operations and do something else for a living, they can do so easily. They must, of course, pay all debts and other obligations, such as taxes, but they do not have to meet any other legal obligations to stop doing business. Many small businesses rent office or storefront space, but there are advantages to purchasing it as well. For example, it can be difficult and expensive to adapt a rental space to the particular needs of your business. However, if you purchase the property, you have the ability to make the changes you want more easily. If you rent, you will not receive anything in return when you move out. If you purchase, the property belongs to you, and you will be able to sell it. Although the upfront cost may be higher, purchasing can be a good option. dRAw CONCLUSIONS Why are sole proprietorships easy to start and end? Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorships As with everything else, there are trade-offs with sole proprietorships.

Sole proprietors are fully and personally responsible for all their business debts. If the business fails, the owner may have to sell personal property&ndash;such as a car or home&ndash;to cover any outstanding obligations. Business debts can ruin a sole proprietor&apos;s personal finances. Limited Access to Resources Suppose you start a landscaping business that grows quickly. You might need to expand your business by buying more equipment. But as a sole proprietor, you may have to pay for that equipment out of your own pocket. Banks are sometimes unwilling to offer loans to a business that has not been operating for very long. This makes it difficult or impossible for many sole proprietorships to expand quickly. Physical capital may not be the only resource in short supply. Human capital may be lacking, too. A sole proprietor, no matter how ambitious, may lack some of the skills necessary to run a business successfully. For example, you may be great at sales but not at accounting. You may love working outdoors as a landscaper but hate to call on people to drum up business. Some aspects of the business suffer if the owner&apos;s skills do not match the needs of the business. Finally, as a sole proprietor, you may have to turn down work because you simply do not have enough hours in the day or enough workers to keep up with demand. A small business often presents its owner with too many demands, and that can be exhausting, both personally and financially. Lack of Permanence A sole proprietorship has a limited life. If a sole proprietor dies or retires, the business simply ceases to exist if there is no one willing to buy it or run it. The same can happen if the owner suffers an extended illness or loses interest in the business. Sole proprietorships often have trouble finding and keeping good employees. Small businesses generally cannot offer the security and advancement opportunities that many employees look for in a job. In addition, a sole proprietorship usually has limited access to capital, which means that most small business owners lack the resources to offer workers fringe benefits. Fringe benefits are payments to employees other than wages or salaries, such as paid vacation, retirement pay, and health insurance. Lack of experienced employees can hurt a business. Once again, the other side of total control is total responsibility: a sole proprietor cannot count on anyone else to maintain the business.

Partnerships and

The Characteristics of
Partnerships
A partnership is a business organization owned by two or more
persons who agree on a specific division of responsibilities and
profits. In the United States, partnerships account for nearly 10
percent of all businesses. They generate almost 15 percent of all
receipts and just over a quarter of all the income earned by all
businesses.
Partnerships are a good choice if owners are willing to share
both the responsibility of running the business and the economic
right to enjoy the profits it earns. They can also be a good choice if
the partners get along well and have skills that complement each
other.
Partnerships fall into three categories: general partnerships,
limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships. Each
divides responsibility and liability differently.
General Partnership The most common type of partnership
is the general partnership. In this type, all partners share

Similarly, they share proportionately in the rewards from the business. Many of the same kinds of businesses that operate as sole proprietorships can operate as general partnerships. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals often form partnerships. Small retail stores, farms, construction firms, and family businesses often form partnerships as well. Limited Partnership In a limited partnership, only one partner is required to be a general partner. That is, only one partner has unlimited personal liability for the firm&apos;s actions. The remaining partner or partners contribute only money. If the business fails, they can lose only the amount of their initial investment. If the business succeeds, though, limited partners share in the profits. A limited partnership must have at least one general partner but may have any number of limited partners. Limited partners play no role in managing the business. The general partner runs the company. That control is the main advantage of being a general partner. The main drawback, of course, is the unlimited liability that the general partner has. Limited Liability Partnerships The limited liability partnership (LLP) is a newer type of partnership recognized by many states. In this type of partnership, all partners are limited partners. An LLP functions like a general partnership, except that all partners have limited personal liability in certain situations, such as another partner&apos;s mistakes. Not all types of businesses are allowed to register as limited liability partnerships. Most states allow professionals such as attorneys, physicians, dentists, and accountants to register as LLPs. CONTRAST What is the chief financial difference between a general partner and a limited partner? Advantages of Partnerships Partnerships are easy to establish and are subject to few government regulations. They provide entrepreneurs with a number of advantages. Ease of Start-Up Like proprietorships, partnerships are easy and inexpensive to establish. The law does not require a written partnership agreement. Most experts, however, advise partners to work with an attorney to develop articles of partnership, or a partnership agreement. This legal document spells out each partner&apos;s economic rights and responsibilities. It outlines how partners will share profits or losses. It may also address other details, such as the ways new partners can join the firm, the duration of the partnership, and tax responsibilities. If partners do not develop their own articles of partnership, they will fall under the rules of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). The UPA is a law adopted by most states to establish rules for partnerships. The UPA requires common ownership interests, profit and loss sharing, and shared management responsibilities. Liability in Different Types of Partnerships BUSINESS LOSS TYPE OF PARTNERSHIP PARTNERS&apos; PERSONAL LIABILITY General Partnership Limited Partnership Limited Partnership $150,000 $150,000 $150,000 General Partner A $50,000 General Partner A $75,000 General Partner A $150,000 General Partner B $50,000 General Partner B $75,000 Limited Partner W $0 General Partner C $50,000 Limited Partner W $0 Limited Partner X $0 >> The table shows how the same business loss might be shared by partners in three different partnerships.

>> Compare and Contrast How do limited liability partnerships differ from the
other two types of partnerships?
Like sole proprietorships, partnerships are subject
to little government regulation. The partnership may
face certain government regulations because of the
nature of its work. Medical partnerships, for instance,
must follow government regulations regarding
safe handling of biomedical waste. Some kinds of
businesses face limits on their operations due to
zoning laws. The government does not dictate how
partnerships conduct business, however. Partners
have the right to distribute profits in whatever way
they wish, as long as they abide by the partnership
agreement or by the UPA.
Financial Impact A major advantage of
partnerships is the ability to raise capital. In a
partnership, more than one person contributes
assets, or money and other valuables. As a result,
these businesses can raise more capital than a
sole proprietorship. In addition, partnerships have
improved ability to borrow funds for operations or
expansion.
Partnerships offer advantages to employees as
well. They can attract and keep talented employees
more easily than sole proprietorships can. Graduates
from top accounting schools, for example, often
seek jobs with large and prestigious accounting
LLPs, hoping to become partners themselves
someday. Partnerships, like sole proprietorships, are
not subject to any special taxes. Partners do have
the legal and economic responsibility to pay taxes
on their share of the income that the partnership
generates, of course. The business itself does not
have to pay taxes, however.
Shared Decision Making In a sole proprietorship,
the owner has the burden of making all business
decisions. In a partnership, the responsibility for
the business may be shared. A sole proprietorship
requires the owner to wear many hats, some of
which might not fit very well. For example, the sole
proprietor may have good managerial abilities but
lack marketing skills and experience. In a successful
partnership, each partner brings different strengths
and skills to the business.
Contrast Why are partnerships better able to
raise capital than sole proprietorships?
Disadvantages of
Partnerships
Partnerships also present some disadvantages.
Many of the disadvantages of sole proprietorships
are present in partnerships. Limited liability
partnerships have fewer disadvantages than
partnerships with general partners. All partnerships,
however, have the potential for conflict.
5.2 Partnerships and Franchises 183]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="250"> <text><![CDATA[ Unlimited Liability Unless the partnership is an LLP, at least one partner has unlimited liability. As in a sole proprietorship, any general partner has full responsibility for any financial obligations the firm takes on. General partners have the potential to lose everything, including personal property, if necessary to pay the firm&apos;s debts. Since limited partners can lose only their investment, they have the economic right to avoid this threat. In a partnership, each general partner is bound by the acts of all other general partners. If one partner&apos;s actions cause the firm losses, then all of the general partners suffer. If one doctor in a partnership is sued for malpractice, all of the doctors in the partnership stand to lose. This problem is not present, of course, in limited liability partnerships. Potential for Conflict As in any close relationship, partnerships have the potential for conflict. If a business has more than one general partner, each one has only partial control over the firm. None of them enjoys as much freedom as sole proprietors do. Partnership agreements address technical aspects of the business, such as profit and loss. Many issues vital to the success of the business exist outside these guidelines, however. Partners need to ensure that they agree on matters such as work habits, management style, ethics, and general business philosophies. Still, friction between partners often arises and can be difficult to resolve. Many partnerships dissolve because of these interpersonal conflicts. Partners must learn to communicate openly and find ways to resolve conflicts to ensure the survival of their business. Lack of Permanence Like a sole proprietorship, a partnership may not outlast the life of one of the general partners. If a partner dies or decides to leave, the partnership might cease to exist unless the articles of partnership state that the business can continue and the remaining partner or partners have the needed resources. IDENTIFY MAIN IDEA What does a person give up by changing from being a sole proprietor to being a general partner? The Franchise Alternative Sole proprietorships can suffer from a lack of resources or the lack of skills on the part of the owner. Some people solve these problems by forming partnerships.

COMPANY >> Analyze Information Which aspect of franchising might be helpful for a relatively inexperienced entrepreneur? that gives a single firm the right to sell its goods within an exclusive market. One type of franchise is issued by government authorities. These franchises give one firm the sole right to sell its goods within a limited market, such as within a national park. In business, too, a franchise signals exclusive rights. A business franchise is a semi-independent business that pays fees to a parent company. In return, the business is granted the exclusive right to sell a certain product or service in a given area. Franchises offer a wide array of goods and services, from fast- food restaurants to stores that sell diamonds. In this arrangement, the parent company is called a franchiser. The franchiser develops the products and systems to produce them to improve efficiency and reliability. Franchisers then work with local franchise owners to help them produce and sell their products. Each owner is called a franchisee. Franchising has become popular in recent years. This is because franchises allow each owner a degree of control. At the same time, the owners benefit from the support of the parent company. Of course, franchises offer both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of Franchises A franchise provides certain advantages that a completely independent business cannot have. First, a franchise comes Bounce to Activate Illustration with a built-in reputation. Consumers may already be familiar with the product and brand. Other advantages help the franchisee assume the responsibilities of the business by supporting him or her in running the business: &bull; Management training and support Franchisers help owners gain the experience they need to succeed by running training and support programs. &bull; Standardized quality Most parent companies require franchise owners to follow certain rules and processes to guarantee product quality. High-quality products attract customers. &bull; National advertising programs Parent companies pay for advertising campaigns to establish their brand names. These ads can increase sales for each franchisee. &bull; Financial assistance Some franchisers provide financing to help franchise owners start their businesses.

ownership structure. Sole proprietorships and partnerships lack
the resources to carry out expensive processes, such as making
cars, or having operations that reach across the country or around
the world. What form of business organization do these companies
have? Most of these businesses are corporations.
The most complex form of business organization is the
corporation. A corporation is a legal entity, or being, owned by
individual stockholders, each of whom has limited liability for the
firm’s debts. Stockholders own stock, a certificate of ownership in
a corporation. Each person who owns stock is a part-owner of the
corporation issuing it. If a corporation issues 1,000 shares of stock,
and you purchase 1 share, you own 1/1000th of the corporation.
Sole proprietorships have no identity beyond that of the
owners. A corporation, on the other hand, does have a legal
identity separate from the identities of its owners. Legally, it is
regarded much like an individual. A corporation may engage in
business, make contracts, sue other parties or be sued by others,
and pay taxes.
>> A large corporation has the capital to
build factories and hire many workers. As
a result, it can produce and sell goods on a
large scale.

    <page pageNumber="254"> <text><![CDATA[ In the United States, corporations account for about 20 percent of all businesses but more than 80 percent of all sales. They generate nearly 60 percent of the net income earned in the nation. Because of the advantages of corporations, most large business firms do incorporate, or become corporations. Types of Corporations Some corporations issue stock to only a few people, often family members. These stockholders rarely trade their stock, but instead pass it on, typically within the family. Such corporations are called closely held corporations. They are also known as privately held corporations. A publicly held corporation, however, has many shareholders who can buy or sell stock on the open market. Stocks are bought and sold in financial markets called stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Corporate Structure While the exact organization varies from firm to firm, all corporations have the same basic structure. The owners&ndash;the stockholders&ndash;elect a board of directors. The board of directors makes all the major decisions of the corporation. It appoints corporate officers such as the chief executive officer or president. These officers run the corporation and oversee its operations. Corporate officers, in turn, hire managers and employees, who work in various departments such as finance, sales, research, marketing, and production. SUMMARIzE A publicly held corporation has Advantages of Incorporation Incorporation, or forming a corporation, offers advantages to both stockholders and the corporation itself. These advantages include limited liability for owners, transferable ownership, ability to attract capital, and long life. Advantages for Stockholders The primary reason that entrepreneurs choose to form a corporation is to gain the benefit of limited liability. Individual stockholders do not carry personal responsibility for the corporation&apos;s actions. They can lose only the amount of money they have invested in the business. If a corporation is sued and loses the case, it must pay the money award, but the assets of individual stockholders cannot be touched. Corporations usually also provide owners with more flexibility than other forms of ownership. Shares of stock are easily transferable.

What effect do you think Internet trading has had on the stock market?
stockholders can easily sell their stock to others and
get money in return. That is not the case with other
forms of business organization.
Advantages for Corporations The corporate
structure also presents advantages for the firm itself.
Corporations have more potential for growth than
other business forms. By selling shares on the stock
market, corporations can raise large amounts of
capital.
Corporations can also raise money by borrowing
it. They do this by selling bonds. A bond is a formal
contract issued by a corporation or other entity that
includes the promise to repay borrowed money with
interest at fixed intervals.Because ownership is separate from the
running of the firm, corporate owners—that is,
stockholders—do not need any special managerial
skills. Instead, the corporation can hire various
experts—the best financial analysts, the best
engineers, and so forth.Corporations also have the advantage of long
life. Because stock is transferable, corporations are
able to exist longer than simple proprietorships or
even partnerships. Unless it has stated in advance
a specific termination date, the corporation can do
business indefinitely.Recall How do corporations raise capital?
Disadvantages of
Incorporation
Corporations do have some disadvantages, including
expense and difficulty of start-up, double taxation,
potential loss of control by the founders, and more
legal requirements and regulations.Difficulty and Expense of Start-Up Businesses
that wish to incorporate must first file for a state
license known as a certificate of incorporation,
or corporate charter. The application includes crucial
information such as corporate name, statement of
purpose, length of time that the business will run
(usually “for perpetuity,” or without limit), founders’
names and addresses, where business is based,
method of fundraising, and rules for management.Once state officials review and approve the
application, they grant the corporation its charter.
Then the corporation organizes itself to produce
and sell a good or service. Corporate charters can
be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to
create. Though most states allow people to form
corporations without legal help, few experts would
recommend this shortcut.
Double Taxation The law considers corporations
legal entities separate from their owners.
Corporations, therefore, must pay taxes on their
income.5.3 Corporations 189 ]]></text>

Bounce to Activate Chart >> President George W. Bush signs the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which instituted regulations encouraging corporate responsibility, especially with regard to accounting practices. Corporate earnings are taxed a second time as well. When corporations determine their profits, they often choose to pay a share of those profits to stockholders in payments called dividends. These dividends count as income for the stockholder, and the stockholder must pay personal income tax on them. This double taxation keeps many firms from incorporating. When stockholders sell shares, they must compare the selling price to how much they paid for them. If the selling price is higher, they have earned what is called a capital gain. That gain is also taxed. Some owners form limited liability corporations (LLCs). These businesses have the advantage of limited liability for owners, which all corporations enjoy. They also have tax advantages because the firm does not pay corporate income tax. Loss of Control The original owners of a corporation often lose control of the company. Corporate officers and boards of directors, not owners, manage corporations. These managers do not always act in the owners&apos; best interests. They might be more interested in protecting their own jobs or salaries today than in making difficult decisions that would benefit the firm tomorrow. More Regulation Corporations face more regulations than other types of businesses. They must hold annual meetings for stockholders and keep records of all business transactions. Publicly held corporations are required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is a federal agency that regulates the stock market. Corporations must also abide by government regulations that affect the use of business property. For example, a corporation that opens a new factory in a city must abide by the zoning laws of that city. It must also make sure that the factory meets regulations designed to ensure that employees work in a safe environment. It must make sure that the factory abides by laws that regulate the safe handling of industrial waste.

Corporations can grow very large. One way to
grow is to raise money by selling stocks or bonds.
Corporations may also grow by merging, or
combining, with another corporation. The three
kinds of mergers are horizontal mergers, vertical
mergers, and conglomerates. Horizontal Mergers In a horizontal merger,
two or more firms competing in the same market
with the same good or service join together. In
2013, Office Depot, an office-supply store, merged
with OfficeMax, another office-supply store. This
was a horizontal merger. Two firms might choose
to merge if the newly established firm would result
in economies of scale or would otherwise improve
efficiency. The federal government watches horizontal
mergers carefully. The resulting single firm might
gain monopoly power in its market. If that is the
case, the government might try to block the merger
in court. Judges then listen to arguments and read
evidence to decide whether to allow the merger.Vertical Mergers In a vertical merger, two or
more firms involved in different stages of producing the same good or service join together. A vertical
merger can allow a firm to operate more efficiently.
A vertically combined firm can control all phases
of production, rather than relying on the goods
or services of outside suppliers. Sometimes firms
take this step out of fear that they may otherwise
lose crucial supplies. Antitrust regulators become
concerned when firms in the same industry merge
vertically, especially if supplying firms suffer.
Most vertical mergers do not substantially lessen
competition, however. Some companies grow larger through a
combination of horizontal and vertical mergers.Conglomerates Sometimes firms buy other
companies that produce totally unrelated goods
or services. When three or more unrelated
businesses are involved, this combination is
called a conglomerate. In a conglomerate, no one
business earns the majority of the firm’s profits.
The government usually allows this kind of merger
because it does not result in decreased competition.

They are called multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs usually have headquarters in one country and branches in other countries. Multinationals must obey laws and pay taxes in each country in which they operate. In 2007, U.S. multinational firms employed 32 million workers. The largest multinational companies in the world include General Electric, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil, and Toyota. Advantages of Multinationals Multinationals benefit consumers and workers by providing jobs and products around the world. Often the jobs they provide help people in poorer nations enjoy better living standards. Multinational corporations (MNCs) also spread new technologies and production methods across the globe. Disadvantages of Multinationals On the downside, many people feel that multinational firms unduly influence the culture and politics in the countries in which they operate. While MNCs do provide jobs, critics say that in poorer countries those jobs are marked by low wages and poor working conditions.

    <page pageNumber="260"> <text><![CDATA[ Man might help another, without any Disservice to himself. &ndash;The New-England Courant, August 13, 1722 A cooperative is a business organization owned and operated by a group of individuals for their shared benefit. In other words, working together, the individuals help one another. Cooperatives are based on several principles, which include: &bull; voluntary and open membership; &bull; democratic control of the organization by its members; &bull; sharing of contributions and benefits by members. Cooperatives enjoy some tax benefits. Like all businesses, cooperatives have earnings. But since they are not corporations, cooperatives do not pay income tax on their earnings as long as they handle those earnings in certain ways. At least 20 percent must be paid out to members. Members, of course, must then pay personal income taxes on that money. The cooperative invests as much as 80 percent of its earnings to maintain or expand its operations. Cooperatives, or co-ops, are found in many industries, from farming and energy to healthcare and child care. They fall into three main categories: consumer cooperatives, service cooperatives, and producer cooperatives. Any group of consumers or producers with common social or economic goals can band together to form a cooperative. Consumer Cooperatives Retail outlets owned and operated by consumers are called consumer cooperatives. They are also known as purchasing cooperatives. Consumer cooperatives sell merchandise to their members at reduced prices. By purchasing goods in large quantities, these cooperatives can obtain goods at a lower cost. They then pass the savings on to members by setting prices low. Examples of consumer cooperatives include discount price clubs, compact disc or book clubs, some health food stores, and housing cooperatives. Some co-ops charge an annual fee for membership. Others require members to work a small number of hours to maintain membership. For example, your health food store may require you to work 20 hours per month to remain in the cooperative. Consumer co-ops range in size from small buying clubs to Fortune 500 businesses. Service Cooperatives Cooperatives that provide a service rather than goods are called service cooperatives. Some service co-ops offer discounted insurance, banking services, healthcare, legal help, or baby-sitting services. Credit unions, or financial cooperatives, are a special kind of service cooperative. People deposit money in these institutions. The credit unions then use those funds to lend money to members at reduced rates. Comparing Corporations and Cooperatives CORPORATION Owned by individual stockholders Owned by its members, a group of individuals Decisions are made by members Main purpose is to help its members Distributes a portion of profits to members Does not pay income taxes on earnings COOPERATIVE Decisions are made by a board of directors Main purpose is to maximize profits Distributes a portion of profits to stockholders Pays income taxes on earnings >> Analyze Charts How is being a member of a cooperative the same as being a stockholder in a corporation?

    <page pageNumber="261"> <text><![CDATA[ Producer Cooperatives Producer cooperatives are agricultural marketing cooperatives that help members sell their products. These co-ops allow members to focus their attention on growing crops, raising livestock, and catching fish. The co-ops, meanwhile, market these goods for the highest prices possible. In a recent year, producer cooperatives sold more than $235 billion worth of crops, livestock, and seafood. These groups are involved in marketing dairy products, grain, beef and chicken, fish, and many other products. Some co-ops have more than a million members. RECALL How do members benefit from each type of cooperative? Nonprofits Some institutions function much like business organizations but do not operate for the purpose of generating profit. For that reason, they are called nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit organizations have no owner. They are often run by a board of directors. Nonprofits are usually in the business of providing some benefit to the public. Examples include museums, public schools, the American Red Cross, hospitals, adoption agencies, churches, synagogues, YMCAs, and many other groups and charities. Almost all of them provide services rather than goods. The government exempts nonprofit organizations from income taxes. The government gives this tax break in order to encourage organizations to meet needs that for-profit businesses might not otherwise provide, such as food or shelter for those who cannot afford them. Nonprofits must meet certain requirements to qualify for this tax-exempt status. Nonprofits cannot issue stock, so any profits that they make cannot be distributed to stockholders. Profits have to be invested in the organization. The group must devote its activities exclusively to those that the Internal Revenue Service says will qualify. For instance, a charity must act only to help people, such as the poor or those disabled by illness or injury. An educational nonprofit, such as a private college, must devote itself to the advancement of learning. Some nonprofits are nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The International Committee of the Red Cross and Greenpeace are examples. NGOs are independent groups that raise money and use it to fund and carry out programs.

They also work with government to promote pro- business policies. they have headquarters. You will learn more about NGOs elsewhere in the course. Other nonprofit organizations provide support to particular occupations or geographical areas. These include professional organizations, business associations, trade associations, and labor unions. Nonprofits have some limits on their political activity. Charities and religious groups, for instance, can meet with members of Congress to try to influence laws being considered. They cannot devote too much of their resources to this lobbying activity, however. Professional Organizations Some nonprofits are professional organizations that work to improve the image, working conditions, and skill levels of people in particular occupations. Examples of this kind of nonprofit include the National Education Association for public school, college, and university workers; the American Veterinary Medical Association for veterinary professionals; the American Bar Association for lawyers; and the American Management Association for business professionals. Professional organizations keep their members up-to-date on industry trends. Many of these organizations provide members with employment- related services such as job boards, training workshops, and networking opportunities. They also set codes of conduct that members are expected to follow. For example, the American Medical Association sets guidelines for certain kinds of advertising. It wants doctors to present a professional, authoritative, and caring image as they seek new patients. The American Bar Association does not favor law firms that advertise their services for personal injury complaints. Business Associations Organizations called business associations promote the collective business interests of a city, state, or other geographical area, or of a group of similar businesses. A city or state chamber of commerce, for instance, works with government officials to try to promote policies that will help businesses grow and thrive. Business associations may also address codes of conduct, just as professional associations do. Your local Better Business Bureau (BBB), sponsored by local businesses, is a nonprofit group. It aims to protect consumers by promoting an ethical and fair marketplace. Consumers who have complaints about the actions of a local business can take them to the BBB. Workers there will contact the business and try to work out a solution that satisfies both parties.196 TOPIC 5 Business and Labor ]]></text>

The American Marketing Association, for example, aims to improve the image of companies that sell goods and services. All kinds of industries, from publishing to food processing, enjoy the support of trade associations. Many of these nonprofits hire lobbyists to work with state legislatures and the U.S. Congress. Lobbyists provide legislators with information about an industry and try to influence laws that affect that industry. Trade associations also hold meetings that members can attend to improve their skills or learn about industry trends.

The Labor Force
Tracking the Labor Force
Economic trends affect workers in many ways. Over the past two
decades, the U.S. economy has shifted from a manufacturing
economy toward a service-producing economy. As jobs in
industries such as technology and financial services have soared,
the number of manufacturing jobs has dwindled.
How do we know the direction of changes in the job market?
Each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United
States Department of Labor surveys households to assemble
information on the labor force. Economists define the labor force
as all nonmilitary people who are employed or unemployed.
Employment and Unemployment Economists consider people
to be employed if they are 16 years or older and meet at least one
of the following requirements:
• they worked at least one hour for pay in the past week;
• they worked 15 or more hours without pay in a family
business, such as a farm or a family-owned store; and
• they held jobs but did not work due to illnesses, vacations,
labor disputes, or bad weather.
People who have more than one job are counted only once. In
2013, about 6.7 million people held more than one job.

To be counted as unemployed, then, a person either must have work lined up for the future, or must be actively searching for a new job. Some groups of people are considered to be outside the labor force. The BLS uses the term “discouraged workers” to describe people who once sought work but have given up looking for a job. They are not counted in employment statistics. In addition, full-time students, parents who stay at home to raise children, and retirees are not considered unemployed, and thus are not counted in employment statistics. Figure 5.1 summarizes the groups that make up the U.S. labor force. The Labor Market Today The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides answers to two important economic questions. First, it says how many people are in the labor force. Second, it tells us how many are employed and unemployed at any given time. You can find BLS data at the Web site for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS provides information about historical trends. For example, the percentage of the U.S. population in the labor force has increased from 59.2 percent in 1950 to 63.2 percent in 2013. The number of employed civilians in the United States in 2013 was close to 144 million. About 76 million of these workers were men. About 68 million were women. The BLS also reports the unemployment rate each month. Economists studying the health of the economy monitor these monthly unemployment figures. In July 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.6 percent. The highest unemployment rate from 1997 to 2007 was 6.3 percent in June of 2003. Beginning in 2008, however, the rate of unemployment in the United States began to rise. In just one year, the rate jumped from 5.8 percent in 2008 to a staggering 9.3 percent in 2009. Then, in 2010, it reached its highest number in nearly 30 years, peaking at 9.6 percent. Since that time, however, it has been slowly but steadily decreasing. In November of 2013, it stood at 6.6 percent.

The jobs that make up the job market also change. New technologies or new industries bring new jobs to life&ndash;and cause others to fade. Shifts in the job market reflect major shifts in what our economy produces. You can better understand these changes by looking at them in a historical context. A Changing Economy At its founding, the United States was a nation of farmers. Most people had few job opportunities beyond the corn, wheat, cotton, and tobacco fields. In the 1800s in the North, however, this focus on agriculture gradually yielded to the Industrial Revolution. The coming of the machine age energized the economy and created new jobs in textile mills, shoe factories, and other new manufacturing enterprises. By the early decades of the 1900s, heavy manufacturing had become the powerhouse of the U.S. economy. New corporate empires were born: John D. Rockefeller&apos;s Standard Oil in 1863; Andrew Carnegie&apos;s steelworks in the 1870s; Henry Ford&apos;s automobile company in 1903. These huge firms employed thousands of workers. The mid-twentieth-century boom in electronics&ndash; led by radio and television&ndash;produced a new surge of factory jobs. Employment growth centered in the Northeast and Midwest, in companies such as General Electric, Westinghouse, Carrier, and Goodyear. In the 1970s, the revolution in personal computers opened another new horizon for employment. As computer use continues to rise, the demand for computer-related occupations continues to grow. In this “Information Age,” even some traditional jobs, from trucking to farming to car sales, now require some computer skills. By the early 2000s, over half of American workers reported using computers on the job. More than a quarter of all workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and construction industries used computers. Fewer Goods, More Services The spread of computers is not the only change that has transformed the American economy. In the past one hundred or so years, the United States has shifted from a manufacturing economy to a service economy. Our production of services is increasing faster than our production of goods. (See Figure 5.2.) In 2005, five workers produced services for every one who produced goods. The service sector includes financial services, banking, education, and online services. Effects of International Competition While the number of service jobs has increased, the United States has lost manufacturing jobs.

>> In a little over 200 years, industry in the United States has changed dramatically.
Analyze Information What 50-year period do you think has seen the most change
and innovation, and why?17.7 million Americans worked in manufacturing
industries. Fifteen years later, the number had fallen
to 14.2 million. Many workers have been laid off due
to plant closings or moves, too little work, or the
replacement of jobs by new technology.
These conditions can be the result of
outsourcing, in which companies contract with
another company to do a specific job that would
otherwise be done by a company’s own workers.
Most companies will outsource work in some way.
In the past, limits on the mobility of capital and
labor meant that most goods sold in the United
States were made by American workers in American
factories. Today, capital and labor can be easily
moved from place to place—and even from country
to country. The movement of some of a company’s
operations, or resources of production, to another
country is known as offshoring. American firms
can build factories and hire workers in countries
where wages and other costs are lower. American
stores can buy a wide range of goods made in foreign
countries to sell in the United States.
As less-skilled manufacturing jobs moved
overseas, the Americans who had filled these jobs
had to find new work. Many went back to school or
entered job training programs to gain new skills.
These shifts in demand for workers are another
example of supply and demand in operation. Demand
for skilled service workers is rising, so wages for
skilled workers go up. These higher wages persuade
more people to train for these jobs to meet the
demand. Meanwhile, as demand for manufacturing
workers drops off, there is a surplus of these workers
who find that they must become more skilled in order
to compete in the job market.
In recent years, businesses have looked abroad
not only for factory workers, but also for the labor of
highly skilled workers. By the early 2000s, companies
increasingly looked offshore for computer engineers,
software programmers, and other high-skilled jobs.
This trend has affected other fields, such as auto
design and some medical services, as well.
Recall Why do companies engage in
offshoring?
The Changing Labor
Force
Not only have jobs changed; workers have also
changed. In the 1950s, a typical American worker
was a white man who had graduated from high
school and had found a secure 40-hour-a-week
job where he probably hoped to stay until retiring
at age 65. Not anymore. Today, more women and
members of minority groups are in the workforce. In
addition, someone entering the workforce can expect
to have four or five different jobs during his or her
working life.5.5 The Labor Force 201]]></text>

More and more, a high school diploma alone is not enough to prepare a person for financial success. To get&ndash;and succeed in&ndash;a job, people need more education. Getting a good education, however, requires money, time, and effort. Higher earnings compensate these workers for their advanced- training costs. Economists offer two explanations for the connection between educational advancement and higher wages. The theory that education increases efficiency of production and thus results in higher wages is called the learning effect. The statistics in Figure 5.3 support this theory. They show that college-educated workers have a higher median weekly income than high-school dropouts. Income continues to increase as people gain even more education. People with doctorates and professional degrees, such as doctors and lawyers, earn more than people with bachelor&apos;s degrees. Another theory about the relationship of education to wages is called the screening effect. This theory suggests that the completion of college signals to employers that a job applicant is intelligent and hard-working. The skills and determination necessary to complete college may also be useful qualities for employees to have. According to this theory, a college degree does not increase productivity, but simply identifies people who may be good employees because of their perseverance and innate skills. Women at Work The changing face of the labor force can be seen at your local bank. A few decades ago, men greeted customers at the tellers&apos; windows and served as loan officers. Today, most bank tellers and many loan officers are women. Women have also taken a greater role in national defense and in police and fire departments across the country. These changes over the past several decades are clearly shown in labor statistics numbers. In 1960, almost 38 percent of women belonged to the labor force. By 2012, that rate was nearly 58 percent. The increase may be due to several factors. One is that women were encouraged to pursue a higher education and add to their human capital. By increasing their human capital, they increased their potential earnings. With the expectation of earning more, more women entered the workforce. In addition, as more and more jobs become available in the service sector of the economy, fewer jobs call for physical strength. Instead, jobs require brainpower and personal skills, placing men and women on equal footing.

Analyze Graphs By about how much did the number of part-time workers change between 2008 and 2009? In recent times, economists believe that women are being affected by the same economic problems as men, including layoffs and offshoring. Nevertheless, for women in their prime working years, there appears to be little change in employment. In 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 69 percent of women ages 25 to 54 were employed. This was down from 74.9 percent in 2000. Temporary Workers In another important trend, more and more businesses are replacing permanent, full-time workers with part-time and temporary workers. These temporary and part-time jobs are known as contingent employment. Some temporary workers come from “temp” agencies. These are companies that have a pool of experienced workers who can be hired out to organizations on a short-term basis. The organization that needs the workers pays the temp agency. The agency, in turn, pays the worker a share of that fee, keeping the rest to cover expenses and profit. Other temporary workers are hired directly by firms as contract workers, people hired for a specified time period or to complete a certain task. Contingent employment is becoming more common even in occupations that had been very secure jobs. For example, some software engineers and attorneys are now hired as contract workers. When the workers complete their part of the project they were hired for, they are released. These highly skilled workers are generally well paid, with some earning as much as permanent workers. Experts have identified several reasons for the increased use of temporary employees. &bull; Flexible work arrangements allow firms to easily adjust their workforce to changing demand for their output. At times of reduced demand, they can easily lay off temporary workers or reduce workers&apos; hours instead of paying employees who are idle. When business picks up, companies can rehire whatever workers they need. &bull; Temporary workers in many industries are paid less and given fewer benefits (if any) than permanent, full-time workers. Thus, hiring more temporary workers cuts costs. &bull; Discharging temporary workers is easier and less costly than discharging regular, permanent employees. Many employers give full-time employees severance pay of several weeks&apos; worth of wages or salary when they lay off workers. They do not have to make these payments to temporary workers. &bull; Some workers actually prefer these flexible arrangements to traditional, permanent jobs. The market, then, reflects their preferences. On the other hand, BLS studies show that a majority of temporary workers would prefer permanent jobs. 5.5 The Labor Force 203 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="270"> <text><![CDATA[ The Impact of Foreign-Born Workers One topic that has received much attention in recent years is the impact of foreign-born workers on the labor force. In 2005, foreign-born workers numbered about 22 million people, nearly 15 percent of all workers in the United States. Many immigrant workers are able to become permanent residents. Some foreign-born workers are guest workers. They are allowed to live and work in the United States only temporarily. Companies that want to hire guest workers must show that they cannot meet their labor needs from native-born workers and that using guest workers will not lower the wages of native-born workers. If companies can prove this, the government gives them permission to bring in guest workers. Guest workers hold jobs in high-tech industries that demand highly skilled workers, and also in lower-skilled work such as agricultural labor. The impact of immigrants on the labor force is hotly debated. Some analysts say that immigrant workers hold down the wages of Americans. This effect shows supply and demand at work. As more immigrants enter the country, they increase the supply of workers. The demand of employers for workers does not necessarily increase, though. With greater quantity supplied than quantity demanded, employers can pay less for their workers as the market reaches a new equilibrium. The result, say critics of immigration, is that American-born workers see their wages drop. They also face stiffer competition for jobs. Other analysts say that immigrant workers fill an important role in the economy. First, they say, lower- skilled immigrant workers do jobs that Americans are unwilling to do because the wages are low. As a result, important work gets done that would not be done otherwise. Second, because immigrants take those jobs, the companies that hire them can charge less for their goods or services, which benefits everyone. ChECK UNdERSTANdINg How is the screening effect beneficial to employers? Wages and Benefits Trends Labor economists study not only who is in and out of the workforce, but how they are doing in terms of earnings and benefits. Today, the picture is mixed. Real Wages Down American workers enjoy higher wages than those in many other countries. In recent decades, though, the paychecks of American workers actually have been shrinking. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that median weekly earnings rose from $232 in 1979 to $770 in 2013.

    <page pageNumber="271"> <text><![CDATA[ there has been no actual increase. To make a better comparison, economists make calculations to hold the value of the dollar constant. This takes away the effect of inflation&ndash;the rise of prices over time. In constant 1982–1984 dollars, median wages actually declined, from a value of $335 per week in 1979 to $332 in 2013. In other words, real weekly wages have fallen about $3 in 34 years. Why have average real wages decreased in the last couple of decades? One reason, as you have read, is that greater competition from foreign companies has decreased the demand for workers. Deregulation of many domestic industries, such as trucking, air travel, and telecommunications, may have forced firms to cut employees&apos; wages as competition has intensified. The increased use of temporary work has also held down wages. Cost of Benefits For many workers, benefits such as pensions and health insurance are a significant share of total compensation. This share rose fairly steadily during the 1900s and early 2000s. By 2005, employer-provided benefits added $7.87 an hour to the cost of workers. Benefits now make up nearly 30 percent of workers&apos; compensation. This adds up to a large cost for employers&ndash;especially since benefits like health insurance are becoming more expensive. Social Security and Medicare taxes are included in these benefits, since they are used to pay benefits to retired and disabled workers. Most workers know that Social Security taxes are deducted from their paychecks each month. Did you know that employers pay a matching amount? Thus, workers and employers share this cost. In addition, Social Security and Medicare tax rates have risen substantially in recent decades, causing further increases in employers&apos; benefits costs. Employers are finding that these rising benefits costs increase the cost of doing business and thus cut into their profits. As a result, some types of contingent employees, such as independent contractors, become an attractive labor resource for companies because these workers do not have to be paid benefits. Offshoring and outsourcing also help firms to cut their expenses. If benefits costs continue to rise, companies will be pressured to pursue these steps to a greater extent. Those responses may prove unpopular with workers.

Supply, Demand, and the Labor
Market
The law of supply and demand applies to the world of labor and
wages. What people earn for what they do is largely a matter of
how many people are willing and able to do the job and how much
that job is in demand. Like eggs or airplanes or pet iguanas, labor
is a commodity that is bought and sold.
In a free market economy, the market finds its own equilibrium
price for labor. In a mixed economy, the government also plays a
role.
Employment or unemployment in a labor market depends on
how closely the demand for workers—the number of available
jobs—meets the supply of workers seeking jobs. Let’s examine
how supply and demand operate in labor markets.Labor Demand The demand for labor comes from private firms
and government agencies that hire workers to produce goods and
services. In most labor markets, dozens, or even hundreds, of firms
compete with one another for workers.
Demand for labor is called a derived demand, because it
is derived, or set, by the demand for another good or service. In
this case, that other demand is the demand for what a worker

In a competitive labor market, workers are usually paid according to the value of what they produce. For example, competition among restaurants results in a wage for cooks that reflects the cook&apos;s productivity. Productivity of labor is the quantity of output produced by a unit of labor. The productivity of a cook&apos;s labor, for example, can be measured as the cost of a meal. Suppose that most of the restaurants in a city pay $12 an hour for cooks and that each cook generates $20 an hour in revenue for the restaurants. The possibility of profit will attract other entrepreneurs to open restaurants. Competition will push up the wage for cooks. As a result, cooks will be paid close to the value of their productivity of labor. Now look at the demand curve for labor, shown in Figure 5.4. Notice that it is negatively sloped, reflecting the law of demand. The higher the price of labor, the smaller the quantity of labor demanded by employers. Restaurants are more likely to hire more cooks at $12 an hour than at $16 an hour, because the lower cost means they can earn more profits on each cook&apos;s labor. Labor Supply The supply of labor comes from people willing to work for wages. As the graph in Figure 5.5 shows, the supply curve is positively sloped, reflecting the law of supply. In other words, the higher the wage, the larger the quantity of labor supplied. This is logical. It simply means that the higher the wage for a job, the greater the number of people who will be attracted to that job. A higher wage for cooks encourages people who would choose other occupations to acquire the training required to become a cook. Equilibrium Wage We know that at market equilibrium, the quantity of a good supplied will equal the quantity demanded. Economic factors&ndash; the supply of labor and the demand for it&ndash;combine to determine an equilibrium price. Because the equilibrium price makes the quantity that suppliers want to sell equal to the quantity that demanders want to buy, there is a tendency for the price or quantity not to change. That stability applies to the equilibrium price in one market, though. These factors may be different in different parts of the country, or at different times. The equilibrium wage is the wage rate, or price of labor services, that is set when the supply of workers meets the demand for workers in the labor Labor Demand 20 16 12 8 4 80 160 240 320 400 Worker-hours per week 0 Hourly wage (dollars) >> Figure 5.4 The graph shows a demand curve for restaurant cooks.

At equilibrium, there is no pressure to raise or lower wages. How do these theories affect how much you should expect to earn working in a pet store or a grocery store next summer? It depends on supply and demand in your area. If stores do not hire many additional workers during the summer and a lot of teenagers want to work, the wage will be relatively low. On the other hand, if stores want to hire a lot of teenagers and few teens want to work, the wage will be higher. ExPLAIN What determines the equilibrium wage of labor? Labor and Skills Why do lawyers earn more money than carpenters, and carpenters more than cashiers? Wages vary according to workers&apos; skill levels and education, as well as according to supply and demand. Jobs are often categorized into four skill levels: &bull; Unskilled labor requires no specialized skills, education, or training. Workers in these jobs usually earn an hourly wage. They include dishwashers, messengers, janitors, and many farmworkers.

Analyze Graphs What is the equilibrium wage, and how many cooks working a 40-hour week would make that wage? Bounce to Activate Chart  &bull; Semi-skilled labor requires minimal specialized skills and education, such as the operation of certain types of equipment. Semi-skilled workers usually earn an hourly wage. They include lifeguards, word processors, short-order cooks, and many construction and factory workers. &bull; Skilled labor requires specialized abilities and training to do tasks such as operating complicated equipment. Skilled workers need little supervision, yet usually earn an hourly wage. They include auto mechanics, bank tellers, plumbers, firefighters, chefs, and carpenters. &bull; Professional labor demands advanced skills and education. Professionals are usually white-collar workers who receive a salary. Professionals include managers, teachers, bankers, doctors, actors, professional athletes, and computer programmers. Labor supply and demand can create a significant difference in pay scales for workers with various skills. For example, the labor market for medical doctors is relatively high compared to the market for construction workers. Because the supply of doctors is relatively low and the demand is relatively high, there is a high equilibrium wage. By comparison, the supply of construction workers is high relative to the demand for them. Hence, the equilibrium wage for construction workers would be much lower than that for doctors. Doctors and other highly educated workers&ndash;and those with extensive training and experience&ndash;enjoy demand for their services that is high relative to the supply, leading to higher earnings. The demand for workers with less education and training tends to be lower relative to the supply, so their earnings are lower. Experienced workers are desirable because they tend to be more productive than those newer to that job. Another reason that earnings vary is differences in working conditions. The level of danger in doing a job, the physical or emotional stress involved, and the location of the work can all change the equilibrium wage. Economic studies have shown that jobs with high accident and fatality rates pay relatively high wages. Workers who do dangerous jobs require compensation for the risk they take. Thus, there is a higher equilibrium wage rate for dangerous jobs, as shown in Figure 5.7.

Analyze Graphs How do the demand curves in the two graphs compare? What can you conclude? Discrimination in the Labor Market As we have seen, wages for a particular job should end up at the equilibrium price of labor for that job. However, some people are paid less because of the social group they belong to. For instance, in the past, women and members of minority groups often received lower wages than white male workers for the same work. This practice is wage discrimination. Some employers defended wage discrimination against women by claiming that men needed the money to support families, while women were simply working to earn extra cash. Discrimination against minority workers reflected racial and ethnic prejudice in society. In recent decades, national or state legislators have tried to end these practices by passing laws prohibiting wage discrimination. Laws Against Wage Discrimination In the 1960s, the United States Congress passed several anti- discrimination laws that prevent companies from paying lower wages to some employees based on factors that are not related to skill or productivity, like gender or race. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 required that male and female employees in the same workplace performing the same job receive the same pay. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited job discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or nationality. (Religious institutions and small businesses are exempt from the law.) The Civil Rights Act also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the provisions of the law. Workers who feel they have been discriminated against can complain to the EEOC, which will investigate the matter. If necessary, the commission can take companies to court to force them to comply with the law. Pay Levels for Women Despite protections, women still earn less than men. This earnings gap has persisted over time. Historically, it has been the result of three factors: &bull; “Women&apos;s work.” Women have historically been discouraged from entering certain high-paying professions, such as medicine, law, and corporate management. Instead, they have been encouraged to pursue careers such as teaching, nursing, and clerical work. With so many women seeking work in these occupations, the labor supply has been generally high. As you know, a large supply of labor tends to produce a relatively low equilibrium wage. &bull; Human capital. Overall, women have had less education, training, and experience than men. This lack of human capital makes women&apos;s labor, in economic terms, less 5.6 Labor and Wages 209 ]]></text>

As a result, fewer women are eligible for the higher-paying, traditionally male-dominated jobs in fields such as engineering. &bull; Women&apos;s career paths. Even today, some employers assume that female employees are not interested in career advancement. This perception can be a roadblock for women in the workplace. The challenges many women face in trying to balance child-rearing and a career adds to this perception. Much progress has been made in creating job opportunities for women. Yet some qualified women still find that they cannot receive promotions to top- level jobs. This unofficial barrier that sometimes prevents women and minorities from advancing to the top ranks of organizations that are dominated by white men is called a glass ceiling. Pay Levels Across Society On average, members of minority groups tend to receive lower pay than whites do. Part of the wage gap has been caused by a history of racial discrimination. On average, whites have had access to more education and work experience, enabling them to develop skills that are in demand. Nondiscrimination laws, in part, are designed to give minority workers improved access to education and job opportunities so they can develop more human capital and lessen the wage gap. (See Figure 5.8.) The entire economy benefits when all workers have a higher level of skill and can be more productive. DESCRIBE How has the government tried to end wage discrimination? Additional Factors Affecting Wages In addition to laws forbidding discrimination, several other factors can affect wages. These include minimum wage laws, workplace safety laws, employer actions, and labor unions. Minimum Wage Laws In 1938, Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act. This law created a minimum wage&ndash;the lowest amount employers could lawfully pay for most types of work&ndash;and required employers to pay overtime for work beyond 40 hours a week. Many states also have their own minimum wage laws. Because of these laws, employers may be forced to pay more than the equilibrium wage for unskilled labor. Supporters of the minimum wage argue that it helps the poorest American workers earn enough to support themselves. Opponents say that artificially increasing the price of labor actually causes a decrease in quantity demanded.

Safety Laws The federal government created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1970 to establish standards for safer working conditions. OSHA policies were issued in an effort to save lives, prevent injuries, and protect the health of workers in the private sector. All laws requiring certain minimum levels of safety also could have an impact on wages. If a law or policy increases safety at work, it may also decrease wages because workers are willing to work for lower wages when jobs are safer. By holding down wages, the law lowers an employer&apos;s costs. Of course, the employer will usually have to spend money to comply with safety regulations, which may more than offset the employer&apos;s savings from any wage reduction. Employers Respond to Wage Levels Employers may also take actions to try to affect wage levels. For example, a company might try to cut labor costs by substituting machines for people. In other words, employers can replace human capital with physical capital. Take furniture making, for example. In countries where labor is relatively cheap, furniture may be handmade by workers. In the United States, where labor is relatively expensive, manufacturers have substituted sophisticated machinery for more expensive human labor. Another increasingly common substitution involves customer service call centers, where automated answering services have replaced live telephone operators to direct incoming calls. Other examples of substituting physical capital for human capital include automated teller machines (ATMs), which take the place of bank tellers, and mechanized assembly lines, which can eliminate the need for some manufacturing workers. These technological advances have greatly reduced the number of employees that banks and manufacturing companies hire. Even if firms cannot use technology to replace labor, they may be able to reduce their labor costs in other ways. For instance, companies may outsource jobs to other parts of the world where labor is more plentiful and therefore cheaper. They may also choose to hire temporary workers.

Although labor unions are becoming less of a force in the American economy, workers might decide to join a union and press for higher pay. A labor union is an organization of workers that tries to improve working conditions, wages, and benefits for its members. One of the key goals of unions is to get wage increases for their members. As you will learn, unions allow workers to negotiate wage levels as a group rather than having to deal individually with employers. Their combined bargaining power is sometimes more effective at persuading employers to raise wages. Nationally, union members do tend to earn higher wages than nonunion workers in similar jobs. In 2012, the median weekly earnings for workers represented by unions were about $200 higher than the median weekly earnings for nonunion workers. That amounts to a difference of $5 an hour for a 40hour workweek. Some economists argue that unions depress the wages of nonunion workers. They offer this reasoning: 1. Unions press employers to raise their members&apos; wages. 2. When wages go up, the quantity of labor demanded goes down. Thus, the number of union jobs decreases. 3. As union jobs are cut, more workers are forced to seek nonunion jobs. 4. An increase in the supply of nonunion workers causes the wage rate for nonunion jobs to fall. In addition, some unions have engaged in featherbedding, negotiating labor contracts that keep unnecessary workers on the company payroll. A notable example of this practice occurred in the railroad industry. In the early days of railroads, a “cabooseman” had to ride at the back of the train to operate a rear brake that stopped the train. Yet even after design changes allowed the engineer at the front of the train to operate rear brakes, unions managed to keep caboosemen on the payroll. These workers received full wages and benefits for doing nothing. People who support unions counter that without the ability to organize, workers have little power compared to that of employers. Unless workers join together, they say, employers can dictate wage levels and working conditions. Since they can usually find replacement workers, their employees might have little real choice. In a later Lesson, you will learn more about the history of unions in the United States. You will also learn about the advantages and disadvantages of unions.

think of Labor Day? Do you think of the
holiday as summer’s last hurrah—a final
weekend spent frolicking at the beach
or enjoying a summer picnic at the park
before school gets underway? The origins
of the holiday can be traced to 1882, when
labor leader Peter J. McGuire suggested
a day celebrating the American worker.
On September 5, 1882, some 10,000
workers marched in New York City in a
parade sponsored by a labor group called
the Knights of Labor. Twelve years later,
Congress made Labor Day a federal holiday
to be spent any way workers wished,
including going to the beach or a picnic at
the park.Labor Unions
Organized Labor
Labor unions support the interests of workers with respect to
wages, benefits, and working conditions. They provide workers
with the power of collective bargaining, which has proven to be
an effective tool to extract concessions from employers.
Shifts in the U.S. economy, however, have had a major
impact on unions. The loss of manufacturing-sector jobs and the
increased number of women in the workplace have been major
factors contributing to the steep decline in union membership
over the past 50 years.
As you read earlier, wages are determined by the forces of
supply and demand. Competition among firms keeps a worker’s
wages close to his or her level of productivity. In general, workers
who command the highest wages are those with specialized skills
and those who are in short supply.
What about employees who feel that they are paid too little,
work too many hours, or labor in unsafe conditions? What can
these employees do? One option is to seek better wages and
working conditions with a different employer. Many economists,
in fact, argue that a competitive labor market helps prevent low
pay and dangerous working conditions, because workers will leave
companies with these characteristics to work elsewhere.

She continued to support the rights of unionized farmworkers and has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. >> In the nineteenth century, children were forced to work in factories. Many American workers have tried to gain some control over their wages and working conditions by forming labor unions. They reason that an individual worker does not have the power to change how an employer acts but that by banding together, workers can win gains from employers. In 2012, only about 11 percent of workers in the United States belonged to a labor union. In the past, though, unions had a strong influence on the nation&apos;s economy. In order to understand the role of labor unions today, we will look at how labor unions rose to power. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS Why do workers join labor unions? The History of the Labor Movement The union movement took shape over the course of more than a century. It faced many obstacles along the way, including violence and legal challenges from companies. Working Conditions in the 1800s Labor unions arose largely in response to changes in working conditions brought on by the Industrial Revolution in the early and mid-1800s. The spread of manufacturing in this period introduced factory work to the United States. By today&apos;s standards, this work was not enviable. In garment factories, iron plants, and gunpowder mills, laborers worked 12-to 16-hour days, 7 days a week, for meager wages. Working conditions were poor. Men, women, and children as young as five years old operated machines so dangerous that many people lost fingers and limbs. Injured workers often lost their jobs. Today, many firms try to retain their most skilled workers by treating them well. In 1855, however, that was hardly the case. One factory boss bluntly summarized his attitude toward workers: I regard people just as I regard my machinery. So long as they can do my work for what I choose to pay them, I keep them, getting out of them all that I can. &ndash;manager of a textile mill in Fall River, Massachusetts, 1855 214 TOPIC 5 Business and Labor ]]></text>

Infer Why do you think the early years of the labor movement were marked by violence? Unions Take Hold As early as the 1790s, whispers of worker discontent grew into organized protests. Skilled workers began to form unions to protect their interests. The chief tool of these early unions was the strike, an organized work stoppage intended to force an employer to address union demands. Employers responded by firing and replacing workers who tried to organize. Workers could not find help in the courts because the courts treated unions as illegal. An important leader in the early years of the United States labor movement was Samuel Gompers. The young cigarmaker rose within union ranks in New York City, focusing on three goals: higher wages, shorter hours, and safer work environments. In 1886, he founded the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Employer Resistance Attempts to unionize brought swift responses from employers. Viewing strikers as threats to free enterprise and social order, companies identified and fired union organizers. They forced workers to sign so-called yellow-dog contracts, in which workers promised not to join a union. (Yellow was slang for “cowardly.”) Companies also used court orders called injunctions to force striking employees back to work. Some companies hired their own militias to harass union organizers or fight striking workers. A Thriving Movement As the nation struggled through the Great Depression in the 1930s, Congress passed a number of measures that favored unions. The expansion of workers&apos; rights in the 1930s contributed to a new rise in union strength. Membership grew, reaching about 35 percent of the nation&apos;s non-farm workforce in the 1940s. Unions became a dominant force in many industries. They controlled the day-to-day operations of activities from shipbuilding to garbage collection to steel production. Unions amassed billions of dollars in union dues to cover the costs of union activities including organizing, making political donations, and providing aid to striking workers. RECALL Why did union membership rise in the 1930s? The Decline in Labor Union Membership As they grew, some unions began to abuse their power. Some sought to preserve outdated and inefficient production methods in order to protect jobs. As you read earlier, some unions managed to preserve job positions that were unnecessary&ndash; called “featherbedding”&ndash;in order to keep more members employed. As a result, companies 5.7 Labor Unions 215 ]]></text>

The reputation of unions suffered further because of their links to organized crime. Corrupt crime bosses gained a foothold in many local unions and used union funds to finance illegal operations. “Right-to-Work” Laws In an effort to curb union power, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This act allowed states to pass right-to-work laws, measures that ban mandatory union membership. Today, most right-to-work states are in the South, which has a lower level of union membership than other regions. Right-to-work laws may be one of several reasons for a decline in union membership in recent decades. By 2005, union membership had dropped to about 8 percent of the labor force. Today, unionism in the United States is far more limited than in many other countries. Decline of Traditional Strongholds One theory suggests that structural changes in the U.S. economy have caused union membership to decline. For example: &bull; Unions have traditionally been strongest among blue-collar workers. These workers perform manual labor, often in a manufacturing job, and earn an hourly wage. The decline of manufacturing activity, shown in Figure 5.9, has caused union jobs to disappear. &bull; Unions are weakest among white-collar employees. A white-collar worker is someone in a professional or clerical job who usually earns a weekly salary.While white- collar workers generally do not belong to unions, workers in the public sector are an exception. Unionization among government workers has increased in recent decades. This growth of union membership has partially made up for losses in the private sector. Some people object when public- sector workers like teachers go on strike. Members of these unions argue that, just as in the private sector, these unions are needed to promote the interests of their workers. &bull; Certain manufacturing industries, such as automobiles, steel, and textiles, have traditionally employed large numbers of union workers. These industries have been hurt by foreign competition in recent years, and automation, including the use of robots, has increased. As a result, many industries have laid off union workers, which has cut into union strength. As you saw earlier, the percentage of workers belonging to unions has fallen in recent years.

Analyze Information How has this change affected union membership? &bull; The rising proportion of women in the labor force (see Figure 5.10) also has affected union membership, since women have been less likely to join unions. &bull; Seeking to reduce their production costs, some industries have relocated from the Northeast and Midwest to the South, which has historically been less friendly to unions. Reduced Need for Unions Another theory for union decline is that other institutions now provide many of the services that had been won in the past through union activity. For example, the government has passed laws setting workplace safety standards and a shorter workweek. It provides unemployment insurance and Social Security. More nonunionized employers offer benefits such as medical insurance. ChECK UNdERSTANdINg What are three explanations for the decline in union membership? Labor and Management A union gains the right to represent workers at a company when a majority of workers in a particular work unit, such as a factory, vote to accept the union. After that, the company is required by law to bargain with the union in good faith to negotiate an employment contract. The Bargaining Process Picture a room and, on each side of a table, a team of lawyers and trained negotiators determined to get what they want&ndash;or at least part of it. This is collective bargaining, the process in which union and company management meet to negotiate a new labor contract. Union contracts generally last two to five years and can cover hundreds of issues. The resulting contract spells out each side&apos;s rights and responsibilities for the length of the agreement. Generally the union comes to the bargaining table with certain goals that set the agenda for collective bargaining talks. Let&apos;s examine those goals. Wages and benefits.The union negotiates on behalf of all members for wage rates, overtime rates, planned raises, and benefits. In seeking higher wages, the union is aware that if wages go too high, there may be consequences. If the workers succeed in getting higher wages and benefits, the company will have higher costs, which can reduce its competitiveness in the free market. If the company can&apos;t compete with other companies, it runs the risk of bankruptcy. As a result, the company may lay off workers to reduce costs. Working conditions.Safety, comfort, worker responsibilities, and many other workplace issues are negotiated and written into the final contract. Job security.One of the union&apos;s primary goals is to secure its members&apos; jobs, so the contract spells out the conditions under which a worker may be fired. If a union member is discharged for reasons that the 5.7 Labor Unions 217 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="284"> <text><![CDATA[union believes to be in violation of the contract, the
union might file a grievance, or formal complaint.
The union contract specifies how such
grievances are handled. The procedure usually
involves hearings by a committee of union and
company representatives.
Strikes When a contract is about to expire, or when
the union is negotiating its first agreement with
a company, the negotiators can wind up in tough
late-night bargaining sessions. Most of the time, the
parties manage to reach an agreement. But when a
deadlock occurs, tensions escalate.
The union may ask its members to vote to
approve a strike. A strike is the union’s ultimate
weapon. A strike, particularly a lengthy one, can
cripple a company. Some firms can continue to
function by using managers to perform key tasks.
They may hire workers who do not belong to the
union, called “strikebreakers.” If a company can
withstand a strike, it is in a good bargaining
position. Most firms, however, cannot produce goods
and services without their union workers.
A long strike can also be devastating to workers,
since they do not get paid while they are not
working. Many unions do make some payments
to their members during a strike, funded by the
dues the union has collected. These payments can help workers, but they are generally much smaller
than what the members would have earned while
working.
It may seem as though workers strike frequently
since strikes are often front-page news when they
do occur. In fact, the collective bargaining process
usually goes smoothly, with few work stoppages due
to strikes. As shown in the graph in Figure 5.11, the
number of work stoppages in the United States has
declined sharply over time. In 2010, there were only
11 major work stoppages across the entire nation.
Outside Help Reaching Settlements If a strike
continues for a long time, the two sides sometimes
call in a third party to help settle the dispute. They
might agree to mediation, a settlement technique
in which a neutral person, the mediator, meets
with each side to try to find a solution that both
sides will accept. A mediator often can help each
side understand the other’s concerns, leading to an
agreement.
However, the decision reached by the mediator
is nonbinding—that is, neither side is required
to accept it. If either side rejects the mediator’s
decision, the dispute could continue indefinitely.
Sometimes, the talks will end up in arbitration.
In this settlement technique, a neutral third party
listens to both sides and then imposes a decision. U.S. Work Stoppages, 1950–2010 Number of work stoppages 500

Lesson 1: Sole Proprietorships LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.5 A sole proprietorship is a business owned and managed by one person. Sole proprietorships are easy to start and end, face relatively few regulations, and give their owners full control of the business and its profits. Their owners, however, face personal liability&ndash;a risk of losing personal property if their businesses fail&ndash;and have less access to capital and less security than other kinds of business organization. Lesson 2: Partnerships and Franchises SS.912.E.1.5 Partnerships are businesses owned by people who agree on a division of responsibilities and profits. General partnerships involve personal liability, but some kinds of partnerships offer limited liability&ndash;a risk of losing only the amount invested. Partnerships are easy to start but risk conflicts among partners. Business franchises are businesses that pay a parent company for the exclusive right to sell the company&apos;s products in a location. They enjoy the company&apos;s assistance but have limited independence and profit potential. Lesson 3: Corporations SS.912.E.1.5 Corporations are businesses whose owners hold stock&ndash; or a share of ownership&ndash;and enjoy limited liability. Limited liability makes it relatively easy for corporations to raise capital. Laws and regulations, however, can make it difficult to start and run a corporation. Corporations may merge with other corporations. Some corporations are multinationals, which operate in more than one country. Lesson 4: Cooperatives and Nonprofits LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.5 Cooperatives are businesses owned by members and operated for their mutual benefit. Any earnings must be reinvested in the business or paid out to members. Nonprofit organizations are generally institutions that exist to provide a benefit to the public. A nonprofit has no owner and is often run by a board of directors. Nonprofits must reinvest any earnings and limit themselves to charitable activities. Lesson 5: The Labor Force SS.912.E.1.9 The labor force consists of all nonmilitary people who are employed or looking for work. The U.S. government tracks unemployment and changing employment trends, including the growth in outsourcing or offshoring. The labor force has become more female and less white. There has been a growth in part-time and temporary jobs, a decline in real wages, and a rise in the cost of benefits such as health insurance. Lesson 6: Labor and Wages SS.912.E.1.9 Wages respond like other prices to supply and demand. Wages depend in part on labor productivity, the quantity of output per unit of labor. For this reason, skilled and experienced workers command higher wages. Wage discrimination has hurt women and ethnic minorities, but laws exist to try to stop it. Other laws set minimum wages and safety standards. Labor unions aim to improve working conditions, wages, and benefits for members. Lesson 7: Labor Unions SS.912.E.1.9, SS.912.E.2.3 Labor unions began in response to the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s. They grew in the early 1900s but then lost popularity. Some states passed right-to-work laws that made it illegal to require union membership for a job. As a result, union membership shrank. Unions may strike, bargain with management, or seek mediation or arbitration to resolve conflicts.Savvas.com/FloridaSS Go ONLINE for lesson summaries AUDIO READING GAMES ]]></text>

Executive compensation has skyrocketed while wages for regular workers have stagnated. Since the 1970s, compensation for regular workers has not kept up with increases in labor productivity. At the same time, executive pay continues to spiral upwards. Fifty years ago, the average CEO in the United States was paid 20 times more than the typical worker. Now that ratio is 300-to-1, far higher than in any other advanced economy. Adding insult to injury, average taxpayers subsidize excessive executive pay through corporate tax deductions. &ndash;House Budget Committee Democrats, “Fact Sheet: CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act” DOCUMENT C An expert on executive salaries discusses the controversy over CEO compensation. So, are CEOs overpaid compared to rank-and-file workers? If you read the media stories this year, and in previous years, you might conclude that they are. Some interest groups have determined that the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay is an appropriate measure of this problem.…. Most CEOs I&apos;ve dealt with are highly intelligent, have advanced degrees&ndash;often from one of the top universities in this country or elsewhere in the world&ndash; and have worked 70 or more hours per week for most of their career. Even if they weren&apos;t CEO of a public company, people with a background like that get paid much more than the average person…. I just read that U2 made $260 million in gross receipts on their 2005 tour. That&apos;s $3 million per show (about $1 million per hour). . . . I don&apos;t think most Americans want to impose an arbitrary cap on CEO pay any more than we want to impose a cap on U2&apos;s concert tour receipts because we know U2 would stop touring, and good CEOs would stop CEO-ing, and neither of those is to our benefit. &ndash;Fred Whittlesey, “The great overpaid CEO debate,”June 2006, http://news.cnet.com 22.

you have just arrived at your

for some money. You find a pen,
keys, and a chewing gum wrapper,
but, unfortunately, no money. Then
you reach into your jacket pocket.
Finally!—a crumpled dollar bill. You
hand the money to the clerk and
take a long, cold drink. The Role of Money
The Three Uses of Money Money, like the dollar you used to buy the soda, serves the needs
of individuals and society in many ways. It provides a means for
comparing values of goods and services, and it serves as a store
of value. Without it, we can’t get the things we need and want.
That’s not the whole story of money, as you will see. In fact, money
has functions and characteristics that you might never have
thought about.
If you were asked to define money, you would probably think of
the coins and bills in your wallet. Economists define money in terms
of its three uses. To an economist, money is anything that serves as
a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.
Money as a Medium of Exchange A medium of exchange
is anything that is used to determine value during the exchange
of goods and services. Without money, people acquire goods
and services through barter, or the direct exchange of one set
of goods or services for another. A barter agreement can be very
useful when neither party in a transaction has money to pay for
the other’s services or goods. It can also lead to cost savings. For
example, a baker’s cost to bake a cake might be only $5. If he
trades that cake for a $25 haircut, it is a savings to him of $20

    <page pageNumber="295"> <text><![CDATA[ Similarly, the barber received a $25 cake for the time it took him to cut a head of hair. Barter is still used in many parts of the world, especially in traditional economies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is also sometimes used informally in the United States. For example, a person might agree to mow a neighbor&apos;s lawn in exchange for vegetables from the neighbor&apos;s garden. In general, however, as an economy becomes more specialized, it becomes too difficult to establish the relative value of items to be bartered. To appreciate how much easier money makes exchanges, suppose that money did not exist, and that you wanted to trade your portable DVD player for a brand-new mountain bike. You probably would have a great deal of trouble making the exchange. First, you would need to find a person who wanted to both sell the model of mountain bike you want and buy your particular DVD player. Second, this person would need to agree that your DVD player is worth the same as his or her bike. As you might guess, people in barter economies spend a great deal of time and effort exchanging the goods they have for the goods they need and want. That&apos;s why barter generally works well only in small, traditional economies. In those small economies, people can devote much of their time to exchanging goods. Now consider how much easier your transaction would be if you used money as a medium of exchange. All you would have to do is find someone who is willing to pay you $100 for your DVD player. Then you could use that money to buy a mountain bike from someone else. The person selling you the bike could use the $100 however he or she wished. By the same token, the person who pays $100 for your DVD player could raise that money however he or she wished. Because money makes exchanges so much easier, people have been using it for thousands of years. Money as a Unit of Account In addition to serving as a medium of exchange, money serves as a unit of account. That is, money provides a means for comparing the values of goods and services. For example, suppose you see a jacket on sale for $30. You know this is a good price because you have checked the price of the same or similar jackets in other stores. You can compare the cost of the jacket in this store with the cost in other stores because the price is expressed in the same way in every store in the United States&ndash;in terms of dollars and cents. Similarly, you would expect seeing a movie in a theater to cost about $8, a new DVD rental about $3.50, and so forth. Other countries have their own forms of money that serve as units of account. The Japanese quote prices in terms of yen, the Russians in terms of rubles, Mexicans in terms of pesos, and so forth. Money as a Store of Value Money also serves as a store of value. This means that money keeps its value if you decide to hold on to&ndash;or store&ndash;it instead of spending it. For example, when you sell your DVD player to purchase a mountain bike, you may not have a chance to purchase a bike right away. In the meantime, you can keep the money in your wallet or in a bank. The money will still be valuable and will be recognized as a medium of exchange weeks or months from now when you go to buy the bike. Money serves as a good store of value with one important exception. Sometimes economies experience a period of rapid inflation, or a general increase in prices. For example, suppose the United States experienced 10-percent inflation during a particular year. If you sold your DVD player at the beginning of that year for $100, the money you received would have 10 percent less value, or buying power, at the end of the year. Inflation would have caused the price of the mountain bike to increase by 10 percent during the year, to $110. The $100 you received at the beginning of the year would no longer be enough to buy the bike. >> Money makes the purchase of goods and services very easy.

You will read more about the causes and effects of inflation later. Define What does it mean to say that money serves as a store of value? The Six Characteristics of Money The coins and paper bills used as money are called currency. In the past, societies have also used an astoundingly wide range of other objects as currency. Cattle, salt, dried fish, furs, precious stones, gold, and silver have all served as currency at various times in various places. So have porpoise teeth, rice, wheat, seashells, tulip bulbs, and olive oil. These items all worked well in the societies in which they were used. None of them, however, would function very well in our economy today. Each lacks at least one of the six characteristics that economists use to judge how well an item serves as currency. These six characteristics are durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. Money Is Durable. Objects used as money must withstand the physical wear and tear that comes with being used over and over again. If money wears out or is easily destroyed, it cannot be trusted to serve as a store of value. Unlike wheat or olive oil, coins last for many years. In fact, some collectors have ancient Roman coins that are more than 2,000 years old. Although our paper money may not seem very durable, its rag (cloth) content helps $1 bills typically last at least a year in circulation. When paper bills wear out, the United States government can easily replace them. Of course, nothing is indestructible. Anyone who&apos;s ever had paper currency accidentally go through washing machine and dryer cycles knows that it doesn&apos;t always come out in “spendable” condition. One negative aspect of currency is that it can wear out in this way. Money Is Portable. People need to be able to take money with them as they go about their daily business. They also must be able to transfer money easily from one person to another when they use money for purchases. Paper money and coins are very portable, or easy to carry, because they are small and light. 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 $1 $1 25 25 25 25 25 25 $1 25 25 25 25 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 $5 $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 $1 $1 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 $1 HOW TO DIVIDE $5 >> One characteristic of money is that it is divisible into smaller amounts. Divisibility of money into small amounts such as coins means that you can pay the exact amount for something that you buy. 230 TOPIC 6 Money, Banking, and Financial Markets ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="297"> <text><![CDATA[ Money Is Divisible. To be useful, money must be easily divided into smaller denominations, or units of value. When money is divisible, people can use only as much of it as necessary for any exchange. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, people actually used parts of coins to pay exact amounts for their purchases. Spanish dollars, widely circulated in the American colonies, were often cut into as many as eight “bits,” or pieces. For this reason, these coins came to be called “pieces of eight.” Today, of course, if you use a $20 bill to pay for a $5 lunch, the cashier will not rip your bill into four pieces in order to make change. That&apos;s because American currency, like currencies around the world, consists of various denominations&ndash;$5 bills, $10 bills, and so on. There are circumstances in which money may not be conveniently divisible. All of the five-and ten- dollar bills in the world, for instance, would not do one much good at a parking meter that only accepts quarters. Money Is Uniform. Any two units of money must be uniform&ndash;that is, the same&ndash;in terms of what they will buy. In other words, people must be able to count and measure money accurately. Suppose everything were priced in terms of dried fish. One small dried fish might buy an apple. One large dried fish might buy a sandwich. This method of pricing is not a very accurate way of establishing the standard value of products, because the size of a dried fish can vary. Picture the arguments people would have when trying to agree whether a fish was small or large. A dollar bill, however, always buys $1 worth of goods. There Is a Limited Supply of Money. Suppose a society uses certain pebbles as money. These rare pebbles have been found only on one beach. One day, however, someone finds an enormous supply of similar pebbles on a different beach. Now anyone can scoop up these pebbles by the handful. Since these pebbles are no longer in limited supply, they are no longer useful as currency. In the United States, the Federal Reserve System controls the supply of money in circulation. By its actions, the Federal Reserve is able to keep just the right amount of money available. You&apos;ll read more about the Federal Reserve System later in this Topic. Money Is Acceptable as a Form of Payment. Finally, everyone in an economy must be able to take the objects that serve as money and exchange them for goods and services. When you go to the store, >> The characteristic of uniformity means that bills of the same denomination not only look exactly the same, but also buy the same amount of goods or services. Bounce to Activate Gallery why does the person behind the counter accept your money in exchange for a carton of milk or a box of pencils? After all, money is just pieces of metal or paper. Your money is accepted because the owner of the store can spend it elsewhere to buy something he or she needs or wants. There are, of course, instances when your currency may not be accepted. We&apos;ve all seen signs in smaller stores that read “No bills over $20,” or “No payment with pennies.” In general, though, in the United States, we expect that other people in the country will continue to accept paper money and coins in exchange for our purchases. This acceptability is one positive aspect of currency. IDENTIfy Who controls the supply of money in circulation in the United States? Sources of Money&apos;s Value Think about the bills and coins in your pocket. They are durable and portable. They are also easily divisible, uniform, in limited supply, and accepted throughout the country. As convenient and practical as they may be, however, bills and coins have 6.1 The Role of Money 231 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="298"> <text><![CDATA[ very little value in and of themselves. What, then, makes money valuable? The answer is that there are actually several possible sources of money&apos;s value, depending on whether it is commodity money, representative money, or fiat money. Commodity Money A commodity is an object. Commodity money consists of objects that have value in and of themselves and that are also used as money. For example, various societies have used salt, cattle, and precious stones as commodity money. The usefulness of objects is what gives them value. If not used as money, salt can preserve food and make it tastier. Cattle can be slaughtered for their meat, hides, and horns. Gems can be made into beautiful jewelry. Tobacco, corn, and cotton all served as commodity money in the American colonies. As you can guess, commodity money tends to lack several of the characteristics that make objects good to use as money. Take cattle, for example. Cows and bulls are not all that portable, or even durable. A cow is not divisible, at least not if you want to keep it alive. That&apos;s why commodity money only works in simple economies. As the American colonies developed more complex economic systems, tobacco and other objects were no longer universally accepted as money. The colonies needed >> These bills were issued during the American Revolution and could be redeemed for gold, silver, or Spanish currency. a more convenient payment system. They turned to representative money to meet their needs. Representative Money Representative money makes use of objects that have value solely because the holder can exchange them for something else of value. For example, if your brother gives you an IOU for $20, the piece of paper itself is worth nothing. The promise that he will do all of your chores for a month may be worth quite a lot, however. The piece of paper simply represents his promise to you. Early representative money took the form of paper receipts for gold and silver. Gold or silver money was heavy and thus inconvenient for customers and merchants to carry around. Each time someone made a transaction, the coins would have to be weighed and tested for purity. People therefore started to leave their gold in goldsmiths&apos; safes. Customers would carry paper ownership receipts from the goldsmith to show how much gold they owned. After a while, merchants began to accept goldsmiths&apos; receipts instead of the gold itself. In this way, the paper receipts became an early form of paper money. Colonists in the Massachusetts Bay Colony first used representative money in the late 1600s, when the colony&apos;s treasurer issued bills of credit to lenders to help finance King William&apos;s War. The bills of credit showed the exact amount that colonists had loaned to the Massachusetts government. Holders of these bills could redeem the paper for specie, or coins made of gold or silver. Representative money was not without its problems. During the American Revolution, the Second Continental Congress issued representative money called Continentals to finance the war against England. Unfortunately, few people were able to redeem these early paper currencies for specie because the federal government had no power to collect taxes. Until the Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789, the federal government depended on the states&apos; voluntary contributions to fill the treasury. As a result, the federal treasury held very little gold or silver to back the Continentals. People even began to use the phrase “not worth a Continental” to refer to something of no value. During the summer of 1780, this wretched “Continental” currency fell into contempt. As Washington said, it took a wagon-load of money to buy a wagon-load of provisions. At the end 232 TOPIC 6 Money, Banking, and Financial Markets ]]></text>

Early in 1789 its value had fallen to two cents and before the end of the year it took ten paper dollars to make a cent. A barber in Philadelphia papered his shop with bills. &ndash;John Fiske, The American Revolution, 1896 Later, the United States government issued representative money in the form of silver and gold certificates. These certificates were “backed” by gold or silver. In other words, holders of such certificates could redeem them for gold or silver at a local bank. The United States government thus had to keep vast supplies of gold and silver on hand to be able to convert all paper dollars to gold if the demand arose. Some silver certificates circulated until 1968, but for the most part, the government stopped converting paper money into silver or gold in the 1930s. Fiat Money If you examine a dollar bill, you will see George Washington&apos;s picture on one side. To the left of the portrait are the words “This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.” In essence, these words mean that this Federal Reserve Note is valuable because our government says it is. United States money today is fiat money. A fiat is an order or decree. Fiat money, also called “legal tender,” has value because a government has decreed that it is an acceptable means to pay debts. Furthermore, citizens have confidence that the money will be accepted. It remains in limited supply, and therefore valuable, because the Federal Reserve controls its supply. This control of the money supply is essential for a fiat system to work. If the money supply grows too large, the currency may become worthless due to inflation. ExPLAIN Although in some societies cattle are used as a type of “money,” why are cattle not a good source of money? >> This note, found on all currency in circulation in the United States, means that our government stands behind the value of the bill.

American Banking
American Banking Before the
Civil War Over time, the American banking system has changed in order
to meet new challenges. In earlier days, people distrusted banks
because they sometimes distributed worthless money and caused
financial panics. In this section, you will see how government
regulations helped increase confidence in American banks. You
will also see how American banking has developed over the years
to meet the needs of a growing and changing population.
During the first part of our nation’s history, local banks were
informal businesses that merchants managed in addition to
their regular trade. For example, a merchant who sold cloth,
grain, or other goods might allow customers to deposit money.
The merchant would then charge a small fee to keep the money
safe. These informal banks were not completely safe, however.
If a merchant went out of business or invested deposits in risky
schemes, customers could lose all of their savings.

Revolution, the leaders of the new nation agreed
on the need to establish a safe, stable banking
system. Such a system was important for ensuring
the economic growth of the new United States. The
nation’s leaders did not, however, agree on how that
goal should be accomplished. The debate on banking
between followers of Alexander Hamilton and
followers of Thomas Jefferson was part of a larger
political debate about the role of government in the
young country.
As you may remember from your study of
American history, the Federalists believed that
the country needed a strong central government to
establish order. The Antifederalists favored leaving
most powers in the hands of the states. These two
groups viewed the country’s banking needs quite
differently.
The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton,
believed that a centralized banking system was a
key to promoting industry and trade. After President
Washington appointed Hamilton secretary of the
treasury in 1789, Hamilton proposed a national
bank—a bank chartered, or licensed, by the federal
government. The bank would have the power
to issue a national currency, manage the federal
government’s funds, and monitor other banks
throughout the country. The Antifederalists, led by Thomas Jefferson,
opposed this plan. They feared that the wealthy
would gain control of the bank and use its
resources to increase their power. They supported
a decentralized banking system. In this system, the
states would establish and regulate all banks within
their borders.The First Bank of the United States At first,
the Federalists were successful in creating a strong
central bank. In 1791, Congress set up the Bank of
the United States, granting it a 20-year charter to
operate. The United States Treasury used the Bank
to hold the money that the government collected in
taxes and to issue representative money in the form
of bank notes, which were backed by gold and silver.
The Bank also supervised state-chartered banks,
making sure they held sufficient gold and silver to
exchange for bank notes should the demand arise.
The Bank succeeded in bringing stability to
American banking. However, opponents of the Bank
charged that ordinary people who needed to borrow
money to maintain or expand their farms and small
businesses were being refused loans.
In addition, the Antifederalists pointed out that
the Constitution does not explicitly give Congress
the power to create a national bank. Therefore,
they argued, the Bank was unconstitutional. When
Alexander Hamilton died in a famous duel with Vice

Financial Chaos in America Once the Bank&apos;s charter expired, state banks (banks chartered by state governments) began issuing bank notes that they could not back with specie&ndash;gold or silver coins. The states also chartered many banks without considering whether these banks would be stable and creditworthy. Without any kind of regulation, financial confusion resulted. Prices rose rapidly. Neither merchants nor customers had confidence in the value of the paper money in circulation. Different banks issued different currencies, and bankers always faced the temptation to print more money than they had gold and silver to back. The Second Bank of the United States To eliminate this financial chaos, Congress chartered the Second Bank of the United States in 1816. Like the first Bank, the Second Bank was limited to a 20-year charter. The Second Bank slowly managed to rebuild the public&apos;s confidence in a national banking system. Nicholas Biddle, who became president >> During the years when there was no central bank, individual states and banks issued currency that was not backed by gold or silver, which led to financial confusion and chaos. of the Second Bank in 1823, was responsible for restoring stability. If Biddle thought that a particular state bank was issuing bank notes without enough gold and silver reserves, he would surprise the bank with a great number of its notes all at once, asking for gold or silver in return. Some state banks, caught without the necessary reserves, went out of business. Others quickly learned to limit how many notes they issued. Still, many Americans continued to be wary of the federal government&apos;s banking powers. They believed that the bank was a tool for the wealthy to further increase their wealth. Although the Supreme Court had ruled a national bank constitutional in 1819, President Andrew Jackson agreed with the bank&apos;s opponents. In 1832, Jackson vetoed its renewal. The Free Banking Era The fall of the Second Bank once again allowed state-chartered banks to flourish. For this reason, the period between 1837 and 1863 is known as the Free Banking, or “Wildcat,” Era. Between 1830 and 1837 alone, the number of state- chartered banks nearly tripled. As you might expect, the sheer number of banks gave rise to a variety of problems. Bank runs and panics State-chartered banks often did not keep enough gold and silver to back the paper money that they issued. This sometimes led to bank runs&ndash;widespread panics in which great numbers of people try to redeem their paper money at the same time. Many banks failed as a result, and public confidence plummeted. Wildcat banks Some banks were located on the frontier. They were called wildcat banks because people joked that only wildcats lived in such remote places. Wildcat banks were inadequately financed and had a high rate of failure. Fraud A few banks engaged in out-and-out fraud. They issued bank notes, collected gold and silver money from people who bought the notes, and then disappeared. Customers who were left holding the notes lost their money. Many different currencies State-chartered banks&ndash;as well as cities, private banks, railroads, stores, churches, and individuals&ndash;were allowed to issue currency. Notes of the same denomination often had different values, so that a dollar issued by the “City of Atlanta” was not necessarily worth the same as a dollar issued by the “City of New York.” The profusion of currencies made it easier to create counterfeits, or worthless imitations of real notes.IDENTIFY Which group succeeded in creating a strong central bank in 1791? 236 TOPIC 6 Money, Banking, and Financial Markets ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="303"> <text><![CDATA[ Stability in the Later 1800s By 1860, an estimated 8,000 different banks were circulating currency. To add to the confusion, the federal government played no role in providing paper currency or regulating reserves of gold or silver. The Civil War, which erupted in 1861, made existing problems worse. Currencies of the Civil War During the Civil War, both the Union and Confederacy needed to raise money to finance their military efforts. In 1861, the United States Treasury issued its first paper currency since the Continental. The official name of the currency was “demand notes,” but people called them greenbacks because they were printed with green ink. In the South, the Confederacy issued currency backed by cotton, hoping that a Confederate victory would ensure the currency&apos;s value. As the war weakened the Confederate economy, however, Confederate notes became worthless. National Banking Acts With war raging, the federal government enacted reforms aimed at restoring confidence in paper currency. These reforms resulted in the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864. Together, these Acts gave the federal government the power to charter banks, the power to require that banks hold adequate gold and silver reserves to cover their bank notes, and the power to issue a single national currency. The new national currency led to the elimination of the many different state currencies in use and helped stabilize the country&apos;s money supply. The Gold Standard Despite the reforms made during the Civil War, money and banking problems still plagued the country. In the 1870s, the nation adopted a gold standard&ndash;a monetary system in which paper money and coins had the value of certain amounts of gold. The gold standard set a definite value for the dollar, so that one ounce of gold equaled about $20. Since the value was set, people knew that they could redeem the full value of their paper money at any time. Now, the government could issue currency only if it had enough gold in the treasury to back the notes. Because of the limited supply of gold, the government was prevented from printing an unlimited number of notes. The gold standard thus fulfilled an essential requirement of a banking >> For many years, gold bars like these were used to establish the value of paper money and coins. system: a stable currency that inspires the confidence of the public.

Banking in the Early 1900s Reforms such as creating a single national currency and adopting the gold standard helped stabilize American banking. They did not, however, provide for a central decision-making authority. Such an authority could help banks provide funds for growth and manage the money supply based on what the economy needed. Continuing problems in the nation&apos;s banking system resulted in the Panic of 1907. Lacking adequate reserves, many banks had to stop exchanging gold for paper money. Several long- established New York banks failed, and many people lost their jobs because businesses could not borrow money to invest in future projects. 6.2 Changes in American Banking 237 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="304"> <text><![CDATA[ The Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve System, or Fed, served as the nation&apos;s first true central bank, or bank that can lend to other banks in times of need. It reorganized the federal banking system as follows: Federal Reserve Banks The system created as many as 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks throughout the country. All banks chartered by the national government were required to become members of the Fed. The Federal Reserve Banks are the central banks for their districts. Member banks&ndash;banks that belong to the Fed&ndash;store some of their cash reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank in their district. Federal Reserve Board All of the Federal Reserve Banks were supervised by a Federal Reserve Board appointed by the President of the United States. Short-Term Loans Each of the regional Federal Reserve Banks allowed member banks to borrow money to meet short-term demands. This helped prevent bank failures that occurred when large numbers of depositors withdrew funds during a panic. Federal Reserve Notes The system also created the national currency we use today in the United States&ndash;Federal Reserve notes. This allowed the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease >> As the Great Crash of 1929 sent stock prices tumbling, people flooded into the Wall Street area of New York City. the amount of money in circulation according to business needs. You will read more about the role of the Federal Reserve and how the system works today in the next Lesson. Banking and the Great Depression The Fed helped restore confidence in the nation&apos;s banking system. It was unable, however, to prevent the terrifying Great Depression&ndash;the severe economic decline that began with a stock market crash in 1929 and lasted more than a decade. During the 1920s, banks loaned large sums of money to many high-risk businesses. Many of these businesses were unable to pay back their loans. Because of hard times on the nation&apos;s farms, many farmers also failed to repay bank loans. Then, the 1929 stock market crash led to widespread bank runs as depositors in all parts of the country rushed to withdraw their money. The combination of unpaid loans and bank runs resulted in the failure of thousands of banks across the country. FDR Reforms After becoming President in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt acted to restore public confidence in the nation&apos;s banking system. Only days after his inauguration, Roosevelt closed the nation&apos;s banks. This “bank holiday” was a desperate last resort to restore trust in the nation&apos;s financial system. Within a matter of days, sound banks began to reopen. Later in 1933, Congress passed the act that established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC insures customer deposits if a bank fails. By 2008, each depositor&apos;s basic accounts in one bank were insured up to $250,000. In an attempt to increase the money supply, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that effectively ended the nation&apos;s use of the gold standard. In 1933, the United States nationalized all gold owned by private citizens and restricted individuals&apos; ability to redeem dollars for gold. The results of these actions were an increase in gold&apos;s value and a decrease in the value of the dollar. Going off the gold standard also allowed the Federal Reserve to maintain a money supply at adequate levels to support a growing economy. These actions, which meant that the nation moved away from representative money and moved toward a system of fiat money, helped the nation recover somewhat but did not end the Great Depression.

Bounce to Activate Gallery Two Crises for Banking As a result of the many bank failures of the Great Depression, banks were closely regulated from 1933 through the 1960s. The government restricted the interest rates banks could pay depositors and the rates that banks could charge consumers for loans. By the 1970s, bankers were eager for relief from federal regulation. The Savings and Loan Crisis In the late 1970s and 1980s, Congress passed laws to deregulate, or remove some restrictions on, several industries. Unfortunately, this deregulation contributed to a crisis in a class of banks known as Savings and Loans (S&Ls). Government regulation had protected S&Ls from some of the stresses of the marketplace. Thus, they were unprepared for the intense competition they faced after deregulation. There were other reasons for the crisis. During the 1970s, S&Ls had made long-term loans at low rates of interest. By the 1980s, interest rates had skyrocketed. This meant that S&Ls had to pay large amounts of interest to their depositors. The S&L industry made many risky loans in the early 1980s. Losses on bad loans forced many banks out of business. A few S&L managers also used S&L funds for their own personal gain. In 1989, Congress passed legislation that essentially abolished the independence of the savings and loan industry. This legislation expanded the insurance responsibilities of the FDIC. Financial “Meltdown,” Bailout, and “Recovery” In late 2006, problems in the U.S. banking industry began to threaten the housing market. The episode quickly spiraled into a full-fledged crisis, the most serious threat to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Beginning in the 1990s, U.S. banks decided to issue “subprime” loans to people seeking to purchase homes. The term “subprime” refers to loans that are made to borrowers with an unfavorable credit history. The higher interest rate banks charge because of the greater risk makes these loans more profitable. Banks began to market these loans aggressively to people who did not qualify for standard loans. Figure 6.1 shows the significant increase in subprime mortgages beginning around 2003. Bankers also devised ways of packaging these mortgages so that they could be sold off to investors. The value of these bundled mortgages, of course, depended on the ability of individual homeowners to repay their loans. The situation reached a crisis point when many homeowners had trouble repaying their loans. This led to a sharp rise in foreclosures, the seizure of property from borrowers who are unable to repay their loans. In addition, housing prices dropped 6.2 Changes in American Banking 239 ]]></text>

This condition became known as having an “underwater mortgage.” The increase in foreclosures hurt investors who had bought the mortgage bundles. A number of the nation&apos;s largest financial institutions that had invested heavily in subprime mortgages were forced into bankruptcy. The ripple effect was great, as hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers lost their jobs. Businesses and individuals found it difficult to get credit. By late 2008, the U.S. economy was on the edge of a financial catastrophe. It was officially in a recession. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, President George W. Bush, and U.S. lawmakers organized a $700 billion bailout of banks, automakers, and Wall Street financial firms. The money was used to help them avoid bankruptcy and to restart the flow of credit to businesses and individuals. In 2009, President Obama signed into law a $787 billion stimulus package, the largest in U.S. history. Approximately one third of the package was devoted to tax cuts; the rest went to spending increases. These included infrastructure projects and support for state healthcare obligations. Despite this, recovery has been slow. Five years after the meltdown, things in the U.S. economy had improved. The real estate market, for instance, was showing real and measurable signs of strengthening with the renewed confidence of buyers, sellers, and lenders. However, big banks were still much too large, excessive debt was still much too prevalent, and household savings rates were still far too low. The recovery was coming slowly and incrementally.

LAFS.1112.RH.2.5 Opinion on the
Constitutionality of a
National Bank:
Thomas Jefferson When President Washington took office in 1789, the
young country’s financial system was in trouble.
Banks had lent too much money and were in danger of
failing. At the same time, the states had borrowed vast
amounts of money to pay for the Revolutionary War.
Lenders were reluctant to lend any more money to the
new government. To regulate the banking system and
finance the U.S. government, Secretary of the Treasury
Alexander Hamilton proposed a national bank.
Washington’s Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson,
strongly opposed such a bank, which he felt would
violate the Constitution and threaten freedom 
. . . I consider the foundation of the Constitution as
laid on this ground: That “all powers not delegated to
the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to
the people.” [XIIth amendment.] To take a single step
beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn around
the powers of Congress, is to take possession of a
boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any
definition.
The incorporation of a bank, and the powers
assumed by this bill [the bill to incorporate a bank],
have not, in my opinion, been delegated to the
United States, by the Constitution.
I. They are not among the powers specially
enumerated [listed]: for these are:
[1.] A power to lay taxes for the purpose of paying
the debts of the United States; but no debt is paid by
this bill, nor any tax laid. . . .
2. “To borrow money.” But this bill neither
borrows money nor ensures the borrowing it. . . .
3. To “regulate commerce with foreign nations,
and among the States, and with the Indian tribes.”
To erect a bank, and to regulate commerce, are

very different acts. He who erects a bank, creates
a subject of commerce in its bills, so does he who
makes a bushel of wheat, or digs a [dollar’s worth
of silver] out of the mines; yet neither of these
persons regulates commerce thereby. To make
a thing which may be bought and sold, is not to
prescribe regulations for buying and selling. Besides,
if this was an exercise of the power of regulating
commerce, it would be void, as extending as much
to the internal commerce of every State, as to
its external. For the power given to Congress by
the Constitution does not extend to the internal
regulation of the commerce of a State . . .
ASSESS AN ARGUMENT Hamilton stated that the
bank would allow the United States to borrow money.
Jefferson argues that the bill to establish the bank
violates the Constitution because the bill does not
actually borrow money. How strong is this argument?

They are not to lay taxes . . . for any purpose they please; but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union. . . . 2. The second general phrase is, “to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers.” But they can all be carried into execution without a bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase. If has been urged that a bank will give great facility or convenience in the collection of taxes. Suppose this were true: yet the Constitution allows only the means which are “necessary,” not those which are merely “convenient” for effecting the enumerated powers. If such a latitude of construction be allowed to this phrase as to give any non-enumerated power, it will go to every one, for there is not one which ingenuity may not torture into a convenience in some instance or other . . . Therefore it was that the Constitution restrained them to the necessary means, that is to say, to those means without which the grant of power would be nugatory [worthless or invalid]. explain an argument How does Jefferson argue against using the word necessary too loosely? How does use of the word torture indicate his point of view? . . . Perhaps, indeed, bank bills may be a more convenient vehicle than treasury orders. But a little difference in the degree of convenience cannot constitute the necessity which the Constitution makes the ground for assuming any non-enumerated power. . . . It may be said that a bank whose bills would have a currency all over the States, would be more convenient than one whose currency is limited to a single State. So it would be still more convenient that there should be a bank, whose bills should have a currency all over the world. But it does not follow from this superior conveniency, that there exists anywhere a power to establish such a bank; or that the world may not go on very well without it. Can it be thought that the Constitution intended that for a shade or two of convenience, more or less, Congress should be authorized to break down the most ancient and fundamental laws of the several States; such as . . . the laws of monopoly? determine meaning How does Jefferson use the words necessary and convenient, and how does he refine the meanings of these words in this text? . . .

A Review of U.S. Banking
History
As you will learn, when American banks need emergency cash,
they turn to the Federal Reserve System for a loan. The Federal
Reserve System is organized to provide this and a host of
essential services to banks, to the federal government, and, most
importantly, to the national economy.
The Federal Reserve in American History The Federal
Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It has
many important tasks, but the most prominent one is to act as the
main spokesperson for the country’s monetary policy. Monetary
policy refers to the actions that the Fed takes to influence the

    <page pageNumber="312"> <text><![CDATA[ Partly because of the impassioned debate over state versus federal powers, however, the first Bank lasted only until 1811. At that time, Congress refused to extend its charter. Congress established the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 to restore order to the monetary system. However, many people still feared that a central bank placed too much power in the hands of the federal government. Political opposition toppled the Second Bank in 1836 when its charter expired. A period of confusion followed. States chartered some banks, while the federal government chartered and regulated others. Banks had to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand. Reserves are deposits that a bank keeps readily available as opposed to lending them out. Reserve requirements&ndash;the amount of reserves that banks are required to keep on hand&ndash;were difficult to enforce, however, and the nation experienced several serious bank runs. The Panic of 1907 finally convinced Congress that it had to act. The nation&apos;s banking system needed to address two issues. First, consumers and businesses needed greater access to funds to encourage business expansion. Second, banks needed a source of  emergency cash to prevent depositor panics that resulted in bank runs. IDENTIfy MAIN IDEAS Why did some Americans oppose the idea of creating a central bank? The History of the Federal Reserve System Attempting to prevent problems such as the Panic of 1907, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The resulting Federal Reserve System, now often referred to simply as “the Fed,” consisted of a group of 12 independent regional banks. These banks could lend to other banks in times of need. Structural Weaknesses Revealed The Great Depression was exactly the situation Congress had hoped to avoid by creating the Federal Reserve System. The system did not work well in that economic crisis, however, because the regional banks each acted independently. Their separate actions often canceled one another out. For example, in 1929 and 1930, the Governors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Chicago wanted the Fed to lower interest rates. Many of the assets used to make business loans had lost value as Central Banks of the United States 1800 1850 1900 1950 2000 1791–1811 First Bank of the United States 1816–1836 Second Bank of the United States 1914–Present Federal Reserve System >> After the end of the second national bank, it took many decades before Congress created a new central bank.

a result of the stock market crash. Lowering interest
rates would address that problem by making more
money available to banks.
However, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors
was against lowering interest rates. Concerned
about the growth of the stock market, the board
favored a contractionary monetary policy—that is, a
policy that did not promote rapid economic growth.
They also restrained the New York board from taking
strong action. Many economists believe that the
failure of the Fed to act contributed to the deepening
of the financial crisis.
Strengthening the Fed In response to the ongoing
depression, Congress adjusted the Federal Reserve’s
structure in 1935 so that the system could respond
more effectively to future crises. These reforms
created the Federal Reserve System as we know
it today. The new Fed enjoyed more centralized
power so that the regional banks were able to act
consistently with one another while still representing
their own districts’ banking concerns. One example
shows how the new Fed helped fight a Depressionera crisis in a small Minnesota town. Picture this
scene:
Outside a bank in the town, a large crowd was
growing frantic. A large number of withdrawals had
badly depleted the bank’s supply of cash. Inside
the bank, a worried banker phoned the Federal
Reserve Bank in Minneapolis—200 miles away—
and begged officials there to send him money. Fed
officers snapped into action. They hired an airplane
and loaded it with half a million dollars packed in
satchels.
Upon approaching the town the
pilot guided the plane low over the
main street to dramatize its arrival
and then landed in a nearby field.
From there the Fed officials were
ceremoniously escorted into town by
the police and the money was stacked
along the bank’s teller windows. The
sight of all that money piled up inside
the bank quelled the customers’ fears
and saved the bank from failing.

The Fed won, allowing it to act more independently in setting monetary policy. In 1980, a new law gave the Fed the authority to set reserve requirements for all banks, even those that are not members. In 1987 and the early 2000s, the Fed acted aggressively to try to reassure investors that it would support financial institutions in times of crisis. That determination was demonstrated in 2008, when the Fed played a leading role in responding to the financial crisis that arose. It made emergency loans to banks that needed funds, purchased large amounts of Treasury bonds, and even bought mortgage-related financial instruments. These actions helped reduce the impact of the financial crisis at that time. Descri be Why did the Fed fail to respond to the Great Depression? The Structure of the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve System is privately owned by the member banks themselves, but it is publicly controlled by the federal government. Like so many American institutions, the structure of the Federal Reserve System represents compromises between centralized power and regional powers. Figure 6.2 illustrates that structure. The Board of Governors The Federal Reserve System is overseen by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Board of Governors is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Its seven governors, or members, are appointed for staggered 14-year terms by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The terms are staggered to prevent any one President from appointing a full Board of Governors and to protect board members from day-to-day political pressures. Members cannot be reappointed after serving a full term. Geographical restrictions on these appointments ensure that no one district is overrepresented. The President also appoints, and the Senate confirms, the chair of the Board of Governors from among these seven members. Chairs serve four-year terms, which can be renewed.

The New York Reserve Bank has a small geographic area but the largest number of assets. Recent chairs of the Fed have been economists from the business world, the academic world, or government. They have a keen sensitivity toward public opinion and an ability to use the media to affect it. Alan Greenspan, a former head of an economics consulting firm and chair of the President&apos;s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), has been the most notable chair of the Fed in modern times. He took office in 1987 and served both Republican and Democratic administrations. After Greenspan resigned in 2006, President George W. Bush replaced him with Ben Bernanke, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers and a former professor of economics. Bernanke learned about monetary policy and the ideas of Milton Friedman as a graduate student. In 2013, President Barack Obama nominated Janet Yellen as the first female chair of the Federal Reserve System. Prior to her nomination, Yellen was the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the President of the Federal Reserve District Bank in San Francisco. Twelve Federal Reserve Banks The Federal Reserve Act divided the United States into 12 Federal Reserve Districts, as shown in Figure 6.3. One Federal Reserve Bank is located in each district, though it may have branches in other cities in the district as well. Each of these banks monitors and reports on economic and banking conditions in its district. Each Federal Reserve District is made up of more than one state. The Federal Reserve Act aimed to establish a system in which no one region could exploit the central bank&apos;s power at another region&apos;s expense. Congress regulates the makeup of each Reserve Bank&apos;s board of nine directors to make sure that the board represents many interests. The nine directors consist of three sets of three persons each. The first set of three represents commercial banks, and they are elected by the district&apos;s member banks. The member banks also elect the second set&ndash;three people who represent the interests of groups such as industry, commerce, labor, services, and consumers. The third set of directors is appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. These three represent the same broad public interests as the second group. The Board of Governors selects one of the nine directors to serve as chair of the Reserve Bank&apos;s board. Each board of directors appoints a president of the Reserve Bank, subject to approval by the Board of Governors. 6.3 The Federal Reserve System 249 ]]></text>

The remaining members are state-chartered banks that join voluntarily. Since 1980, all banks have equal access to Fed services, whether or not they are Fed members. These services include reserve loans to banks in need of short-term cash. Each of the approximately 2,400 Fed member banks contributes a small amount of money to join the system. In return, it receives stock in the system. This stock earns the bank dividends from the Fed at a rate of up to 6 percent. The fact that the banks themselves, rather than a government agency, own the Federal Reserve gives the system a high degree of political independence. This independence helps the Fed to make decisions that best suit the interests of the country as a whole. The Federal Open Market Committee The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes key monetary policy decisions about interest rates and the growth of the money supply in the United States. The committee meets about eight times a year in private to discuss the cost and availability of credit, for businesses and consumers, across the country. Announcements of the FOMC&apos;s decisions can affect >> The Federal Reserve is the banker for the United States government. The Fed processes all checks that the government writes, such as payments to members of the military. financial markets and rates for home mortgages, as well as many economic institutions around the world. Members of the Federal Open Market Committee are drawn from the Board of Governors and the 12 district banks. All seven members of the Board of Governors sit on the FOMC, as do five of the 12 district bank presidents. The president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is a permanent member. The four other district presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. The Board of Governors holds a majority of the seats on the FOMC, giving it effective control over the committee&apos;s actions. After meeting with the FOMC, the chair of the Board of Governors announces the committee&apos;s decisions to the public. The Federal Reserve Banks and financial markets spring into action as they react to Fed decisions. IDENTIfy What is the role of each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks? The Fed&apos;s Roles: Serving the Government Your summer job is going great&ndash;you like the work, and it pays well. The trouble is, the paychecks are handed out just once a month, and you desperately need that first paycheck. Finally, the end of the month arrives, and you rush to your bank to cash your paycheck. But the bank teller has an unpleasant surprise for you. The bank will not credit the amount to your account until the paycheck clears. It will take at least two days, the teller says, for the check- clearing process to be completed. The teller doesn&apos;t explain&ndash;probably because he or she doesn&apos;t know&ndash;that most check-clearing functions in the United States are handled through the Federal Reserve. What else does the Fed do? As the central bank of the United States, the 12 district banks that make up the core of the Federal Reserve System carry out several important functions. Among the most important of these functions is to provide banking and fiscal services to the federal government. Acting as the Government&apos;s Banker and Agent The United States government pays out about $1.2 trillion each year to support such social insurance programs as Medicare, Social Security, and veterans&apos; benefits.

For example, if you receive a check from the federal government and cash it at your local bank, it is the Federal Reserve that deducts the amount from the Treasury&apos;s account. The Federal Reserve also serves as a financial agent for the Treasury Department and other government agencies. The Fed sells, transfers, and redeems securities such as government bonds, bills, and notes. It also makes interest payments to the people holding these securities. The Treasury Department auctions off government bills, bonds, and notes to finance the many programs of the U.S. government. Funds raised from these auctions are automatically deposited into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Issuing Currency for the Government Only the federal government can issue currency. The Treasury Department issues coins minted at the United States Mint. The district Federal Reserve Banks issue paper currency. You may have one now&ndash;the bill says “Federal Reserve Note.” As bills become worn out or torn, the Fed takes them out of circulation and replaces them with fresh ones. RECALL How does the Federal Reserve serve as the government&apos;s banker? The Fed&apos;s Roles: Serving and Regulating Banks The Federal Reserve also provides services to banks throughout the nation. It clears checks, safeguards bank resources, and lends funds to help banks that need to borrow in order to maintain their legally required reserves. It also coordinates the activities of a number of state and federal regulatory authorities. Clearing Checks Check clearing is the process by which banks record whose account gives up money and whose account receives money as a result of a customer writing a check. The Fed can clear millions of checks at any one time using high-speed equipment. Most checks clear within two days&ndash;a remarkable achievement when you consider that the Fed processes about 18 billion checks per year. Supervising Banking Practices To ensure stability of the banking system, the Federal Reserve monitors banks&apos; reserves. Each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks sends out bank examiners to check up on lending and other financial activities of member banks. As part of the Fed&apos;s role in supervising banks, the Board of Governors studies proposed bank mergers and bank holding company charters to ensure competition in the banking and financial industries. A bank holding company is a company that owns more than one bank. The Board of Governors 6.3 The Federal Reserve System 251 ]]></text>

Acting as Lender of Last Resort Under normal circumstances, banks lend each other money on a day-to-day basis, using money from their reserve balances. These funds are called federal funds. The interest rate that banks charge each other for these loans is the federal funds rate. Banks also borrow from the Federal Reserve, especially in financial emergencies such as recessions. The Fed acts as a lender of last resort, making emergency loans to commercial banks so that they can maintain required reserves. The rate the Federal Reserve charges for these loans is called the discount rate. The Fed&apos;s Expanded Role A serious financial crisis erupted in 2008. It began because many banks had made home loans that borrowers were unable to repay. As the crisis deepened, corporations and other borrowers could not obtain loans from banks, and the financial system ceased to function effectively. The Federal Reserve responded to this crisis by changing the size and scope of its involvement in the economy. When banks stopped lending each other money, the Fed fulfilled its role as lender of last resort. It also began purchasing assets, as total assets increased during 2008 from less than $1 trillion to over $2 trillion. Prior to the financial crisis, most of the Fed&apos;s assets consisted of government securities. To help the mortgage market through the financial crisis, the Fed bought mortgage-backed securities. In 2010, the Fed held over $1 trillion of these financial instruments. The Fed took two other significant steps during the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve worked with some central banks in other countries to create “swap lines.” In these arrangements, the Fed loaned dollars to the foreign banks for a short period of time. The foreign banks could lend those funds in their own countries but had to repay the Fed&ndash;with interest&ndash;in a specified time period. The second unusual measure was that the FOMC reduced the discount rate nearly to 0 percent in late 2008. This move aimed at lowering interest rates in the hopes of jump-starting the economy. The FOMC kept the rate at this extremely low level late into 2013. Monitoring Reserves United States banks operate under a fractional reserve system. Banks hold in reserve only a fraction of their funds&ndash;just enough to meet customers&apos; expected daily needs. Banks then lend their remaining funds, charging interest to earn returns.

Analyze Charts When was it cheaper to borrow money, in 2000 or 2010? Why? Each financial institution that holds deposits for customers must report daily to the Fed about its reserves and activities. The Fed uses these reserves to control how much money is in circulation. Conducting Bank Examinations The Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies also examine banks periodically to ensure that each institution is obeying laws and regulations. Examiners may make unexpected bank visits to ensure that banks are following sound lending practices. Bank examiners can force banks to sell risky investments or to declare loans that will not be repaid as losses. If examiners find that a bank has taken excessive risks, they may classify that institution as a problem bank and force it to undergo more frequent examinations. The Federal Reserve also protects consumers by enforcing truth-in-lending laws, which require lenders to provide full and accurate information about loan terms. Under a provision called Regulation Z, consumers receive useful information about retail credit terms, automobile loans, and home mortgages. IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS Why does the Federal Reserve conduct bank examinations? The Fed&apos;s Roles: Regulating the Money Supply The Federal Reserve is best known for its role in regulating the nation&apos;s money supply. To do so, it uses several tools: setting the discount rate, setting reserve requirements, setting the federal funds rate target, and using open market operations to meet that target. Economists and the Fed watch several indicators of the money supply. M1 is a measure of the funds that are easily accessible or in circulation. M2 includes the funds counted in M1 as well as money market accounts and savings instruments. You will read more about these measurements in the next Lesson. The Fed compares various measures of the money supply with the likely demand for money to determine when and how to use these tools. The Demand for Money People and firms need to have a certain amount of cash on hand to make purchases&ndash;to buy groceries, supplies, clothing, and so forth. The more of your wealth you hold as money, the easier it will be to make these transactions. Of course, we can&apos;t earn interest on money that we hold as cash. As interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive to hold money as cash rather than 6.3 The Federal Reserve System 253 ]]></text>

That is, not investing when interest rates are high means you don&apos;t realize earnings you otherwise would realize. So, as interest rates rise, people and firms will generally keep their wealth in assets such as bonds, stocks, or savings accounts rather than in cash. The higher that interest rates are, the lower the demand for money. The final factor that influences money demand is the general level of income. As GDP or real income rises, families and firms keep more of their wealth or income in cash. Stabilizing the Economy The laws of supply and demand affect money, just as they affect everything else in the economy. Too much money in the economy leads to inflation. In inflationary times, it takes more money to purchase the same goods and services. It is the Fed&apos;s job to keep the money supply stable. Ideally, if real GDP grew smoothly and the economy stayed at full employment, the Fed would increase the money supply just enough to match the growth in the demand for money, thus keeping inflation low. It is difficult to predict economic effects. however. The Fed has to be careful in using monetary policy to regulate the money supply. IDENTIfy What is the effect of too much money in circulation?

About 45 percent of M1 is made up of currency held by the public, that is, all currency held outside of bank vaults. Another large component of M1 is deposits in checking accounts. Funds in checking accounts are also called demand deposits, because checks can be paid “on demand,” that is, at any time. Until the 1980s, checking accounts did not pay interest. When they began paying interest, the Fed introduced a new component to measure M1, called other checkable deposits, to describe those accounts. Today this category is not as meaningful as it once was, since many checking accounts only pay interest if the balance is sufficiently high. Traveler&apos;s checks make up a very small part of M1. Unlike personal checks, traveler&apos;s checks can be easily turned into cash. M2 As you can see in Figure 6.5, M2 consists of all the assets in M1 plus several additional assets. These additional M2 funds cannot be used as cash directly but can be converted to cash fairly easily. M2 assets are also called near money. For example, deposits in savings accounts are included in M2. They are not included in M1 because they cannot be used directly in financial exchanges.  You cannot hand a sales clerk your savings account passbook to pay for a new backpack. You can, however, withdraw money from your savings account and then use that money to buy a backpack. Deposits in money market mutual funds are also included as part of M2. These are funds that pool money from a large number of small savers to purchase short-term government and corporate securities. They earn interest and can be used to cover checks written over a certain minimum amount, such as $250. IDENTIFY Which category of the money supply includes deposits in money market mutual funds?

As you have already read, FDIC insurance protects people from losing their money if the bank is unable to repay funds. Saving Money Banks offer a variety of ways for people to save money. Four of the most common ways are savings accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Savings accounts and checking accounts are the most common types of bank accounts. They are especially useful for people who need to make frequent withdrawals. Savings accounts and most checking accounts pay interest at an annual rate. These accounts offer practically no risk, but the financial cost of them is that the interest rates are very low. Money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) are special kinds of savings accounts that pay a higher rate of interest than savings and checking accounts. Money market accounts allow you to save and to write a limited number of checks. Interest rates are not fixed; they can move up or down. CDs, on the other hand, offer a guaranteed rate of interest. Funds placed in a CD, however, cannot be removed until the end of a certain time period, such as one or two years. CDs, like savings anc checking accounts, have little risk, but customers who remove their money before that time pay a penalty for early withdrawal. Interest allows consumers to earn money from their savings when they maintain bank accounts or purchase CDs. For example, a person with $25,000 in a savings account with an annual interest rate of 3 percent will earn $750 in a year. Over time, these earnings will add up and increase savings. Consumers can use these savings to put a down payment on a house, pay for college, or fund their retirement. Savings are also helpful when something unforeseen, like a job layoff, happens. Making Loans Banks also perform the important service of providing loans. As you have read, the first banks started doing business when goldsmiths issued paper receipts. These receipts represented gold coins that the goldsmiths held in safe storage for their customers. They would charge a small fee for this service. In early banks, those receipts were fully backed by gold&ndash;every customer who held a receipt could be sure that the goldsmith kept the equivalent amount of gold in his safe. Gradually, however, goldsmiths realized that their customers seldom, if ever, asked for all of their gold on one day. Goldsmiths could thus lend out half or even three quarters of their gold at any one time and still have enough gold to handle customer demand. Why did goldsmiths want to lend 6.4 The Functions of Modern Banks 257 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="324"> <text><![CDATA[gold? The answer is that they charged interest on their loans. By keeping just enough gold reserves to cover demand, goldsmiths could run a profitable business lending deposits to borrowers and earning interest. A banking system that keeps only a fraction of its funds on hand and lends out the remainder is called fractional reserve banking. Like the early banks, today&apos;s banks also operate on this principle. The more money a bank lends out, and the higher the interest rate it charges borrowers, the more profit the bank is able to make. By making loans, banks help new businesses get started, and they help established businesses grow. When a business gets a loan, that business can create new jobs by hiring new workers or investing in physical capital in order to increase production. A business that gets a loan may also help other businesses grow. Suppose you and a friend want to start a window-washing business. Your business will need supplies, like window cleaner and ladders, so the companies that make your supplies will also benefit. They may even hire workers to expand their businesses. Banks also make loans to consumers. For example, banks lend money to people to purchase cars, which are expensive and difficult to pay for all at once. Consumers also borrow money from banks to purchase homes, make improvements to their homes, and pay for college. Banks earn money on the interest they charge to consumers. Bankers must, however, consider the security of the loans they make. Suppose borrowers default, or fail to pay back their loans. Then the bank may lose a large part, or even the entire amount, of the money it has loaned. Bankers, therefore, always face a tradeoff between profits and safety. If they make too many bad loans&ndash;loans that are not repaid&ndash;they may go out of business altogether. People who borrow money take on a lot of responsibility. They are obligated to pay the bank the amount of money they borrowed in a timely manner, usually on a monthly basis, plus interest. Borrowers who don&apos;t repay their loans or make late payments will see their credit scores suffer, have their property repossessed if they put collateral down for the loan, have their wages garnished to pay the loan, and possibly lose the ability to obtain loans in the future. Mortgages A mortgage is a specific type of loan that is used to buy real estate. Suppose the Lee family wants to buy a house for $250,000. They are unlikely to have the cash on hand to be able to pay for the house. Like almost all home buyers, they will need to take out a mortgage. $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K Customer A deposits $10,000 in Bank 1. Bank 1 can lend 80% of the money deposited, or $8,000. It holds 20%, or $2,000, in reserve and lends the rest to Customer B. From the original $10,000, three banks have lent out a total of $19,520, and placed $4,880 in their reserves. The reserves protect the banks against demands for withdrawals. Customer B spends the $8,000, which gets deposited in Bank 2. Bank 2 lends 80%, or $6,400, to Customer C and holds $1,600 in reserve. Customer C spends the $6,400, which gets deposited in Bank 3. Bank 3 then lends 80%, or $5,120, to Customer D A and holds $1,280 in reserve. 1 1 B 2 C 3 D $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K HOWDOES THE FRACTIONAL RESERVE SYSTEM WORK? >> The Fed requires banks to keep a fraction of their funds on hand and lend the remainder to customers.

Analyze Graphs Why is the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage higher than the rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage? The Lees can afford to make a down payment of 20 percent of the price of the house, or $50,000. After investigating the Lees&apos; creditworthiness, their bank agrees to lend them the remaining $200,000 so that they can purchase their new house. Mortgages usually last for 15, 25, or 30 years. According to the terms of their loan, the Lees are responsible for paying back the loan, plus whatever interest the bank charges, in regular monthly payments over a period of 25 years. Buying a home can provide many benefits, but it also can come with costs. One benefit is stability. Unlike renters, homeowners with a fixed-rate mortgage can expect to pay the same amount every year for the duration of the loan. Because homes typically increase in value over time, people often make money when they sell their home. However, many home buyers have to use a large portion of their savings for a down payment. They also have less mobility than renters. For example, a renter who finds a new job in a different city will be able to relocate more easily than a homeowner. Credit Cards Another service that banks provide is issuing credit cards&ndash;cards entitling their owners to buy goods and services based on the owners&apos; promises to pay. How do credit cards work? Suppose you buy a sleeping bag and tent for $150 on May 3. Your credit card bill may not arrive until June. You do not actually pay for the gear until you pay that bill. In the meantime, however, the credit card issuer (often a bank) will have paid the sporting-goods store. Your payment repays the bank for the “loan” of $150. If you do not pay your credit card bill in full when you receive it, you will end up paying a high rate of interest on that loan. A positive aspect of credit cards is that they give people the ability to purchase goods they might not have been able to afford otherwise. For example, you might want to purchase $500 worth of gear for a camping trip next weekend. Because you won&apos;t have that amount of money in your checking account until you get paid in two weeks, you can use a credit card. Using a credit card will help build credit, which is needed for getting a loan to buy a car or house. A negative aspect of credit cards is that items purchased with credit cards sometimes wind up costing more than their price tag. If you purchased the camping gear with a card that had a 15 percent interest rate and you sent your credit card company $50 a month for 11 months, the total you would pay for the gear would be about $538. People who frequently make purchases with credit cards run the risk of incurring high debts that are difficult to pay back. 6.4 The Functions of Modern Banks 259 ]]></text>

Simple interest is interest paid only on principal. For example, if you deposit $100 in a savings account at 5 percent simple interest, you will make $5 in a year (assuming that interest is paid annually). Suppose that you leave the $5 in interest in the bank, so that at the end of the year you have $105 in your account&ndash;$100 in principal and $5 in interest. Compound interest is interest paid on both principal and accumulated interest. That means that in the second year, as long as you leave both the principal and the interest in your account, interest will be paid on $105. In Figure 6.6, you can see how an account paying compound interest grows over time. Making a Profit The largest source of income for banks is the interest they receive from customers who have taken loans. Banks, of course, also pay out interest on customers&apos; savings and most checking accounts. The amount of interest they pay out, however, is less than the amount of interest they charge on loans. The difference in the amounts is how banks cover their costs and make a profit. IDENTIfy What type of loan helps a person purchase a home?  Types of Financial Institutions Several kinds of financial institutions operate in the United States. These include commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and credit unions. Commercial Banks Commercial banks, which traditionally served businesses, offer a wide range of services today. Commercial banks offer checking accounts, accept deposits, and make loans to businesses and to individuals. Some commercial banks are chartered by states and are regulated by state authorities and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). About one third of all commercial banks are national banks and are part of the Federal Reserve System. Commercial banks provide the most services and play the largest role in the economy of any type of bank. Savings and Loan Associations Savings and loan associations (S&Ls), which you read about in Text 2, were originally chartered to lend money for building homes during the mid-1800s. Members of S&Ls deposited funds into a large general fund and then borrowed enough money to build their own houses. Savings and loan associations are also called thrifts because they originally enabled “thrifty” working- class people&ndash;that is, people who were careful with their money&ndash;to save up and borrow enough to build Compound Interest YEAR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT INTEREST EARNED AT 5% PRINCIPAL AT END OF YEAR $100.00 $105.00 $110.25 $121.55 $155.13 $197.99 1 2 3 5 10 15 $5.00 $5.25 $5.51 $6.08 $7.77 $9.90 $105.00 $110.25 $115.76 $127.63 $162.90 $207.89  >> Figure 6.6 A $100 deposit, when compounded yearly at 5 percent, will more than double in value over 15 years.

Analyze Graphs About how many more commercials banks are there in the United States than savings banks? or buy their own homes. Over time, S&Ls have taken on many of the same functions as commercial banks. Savings Banks Mutual savings banks (MSBs) originated in the early 1800s to serve people who made smaller deposits and transactions than commercial banks wished to handle. Mutual savings banks were owned by the depositors themselves, who shared in any profits. Later, many MSBs began to sell stock to raise additional capital. These institutions became simply savings banks because depositors no longer owned them. Although savings banks were traditionally concentrated in the Northeast, they had an important influence on the national economy. In 1972, the Consumer&apos;s Savings Bank of Worcester, Massachusetts, introduced a Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) account, a type of checking account that pays interest. NOW accounts became available nationwide in 1980. Credit Unions Credit unions are cooperative lending associations usually established by and for particular groups, usually employees of a specific firm or government agency. Some are open to an entire community. Credit unions are commonly fairly small and specialize in consumer loans, usually at interest rates favorable to members. Some credit unions also provide checking account services. Finance Companies Finance companies make installment loans to consumers. These loans spread the cost of major purchases such as computers, cars, and large appliances over a number of months. Because people who borrow from finance companies more frequently fail to repay the loans, finance companies generally charge higher interest rates than banks do. IDENTIfy Which type of financial institution plays the largest role in the economy? Budgeting Consumers can benefit from a range of financial services. In order to take advantage of them, though, you need to be able to budget your money. Income and Expenses The first step in budgeting is figuring out your income and expenses. Add up all of your sources of income, whether from a job, allowance, or other sources. Next, add up your expenses. If you are not sure of these, keep a spending diary for a month. Every time you spend even a little money, note the amount you spent and what you spent it on in a notebook or a smart device. At the end of the month, create a list of categories 6.4 The Functions of Modern Banks 261 ]]></text>

Bounce to Activate Chart of spending, such as transportation, food, and entertainment. Assign every purchase to a category, and add up the amounts in each category. Now you know your expenses. Your monthly expenses should add up to less than your income. That way, you will be able to put aside savings. Savings provide a cushion when you face an unexpected expense, like a broken-down car or a sick pet. Savings can also provide a downpayment for a major purchase, such as a car or a house. If you spend more than your income, you will end up owing money, or in debt. When you are in debt, you have to pay interest on your debt. The interest expense leaves you with less to spend on the things you want and makes it harder to pay off the debt. If you spend more than your income, look at your categories of spending and decide where to cut back. A Credit Plan and Savings Budgeting to build up savings is also a key part of constructing a credit plan. A credit plan will help you to build a good credit record. With a good credit record, you will pay less in interest and have more money to spend on things you want when you need to borrow for a major purchase. The first step in creating a credit plan is budgeting. If you are already in debt, make sure to set aside enough of your income, after expenses, to pay off your debt as quickly as possible. Once you are out of debt, your next goal is to save. Figure out how much it would cost to cover all of your expenses for six months if you had no income. You should save at least enough to live on for six months, and preferably for a year, as a safety cushion. If you want to make a major purchase, you should save enough, in addition to that cushion, to cover a downpayment. Another key part of a credit plan is to budget enough every month to pay all of your bills, and to pay every bill on time, every month. Your credit record depends mainly on your record of on-time bill payment. Building Credit If you do not have a credit card yet, and you want to build your credit, the next step in a credit plan is to obtain a credit card and use it responsibly. That means making sure that any purchases on the card are within your budget, and paying the card off every month. To establish a credit record, you might need to get a secured credit card, with a deposit from your savings as security. You may also be able to obtain a first credit card if a parent cosigns the card, indicating that they will pay if you do not. But your goal is never to miss a payment so that you can obtain an unsecured credit card on your own to use responsibly. With careful budgeting and a credit plan, you will be able to achieve any goal that is within your means, such as paying for a home or a car, or even starting your own business.

Investment and Free Enterprise
There are both benefits and risks to savings and investment. The
savings you put in the bank will grow with almost no risk to the
principle.
However, as this section points out, a properly timed
investment can bring a much greater reward than the same
money put away in savings. On the other hand, if your investment
is wrongly placed or ill-timed, you may wish you had never taken
the money out of the bank.
In its most general sense, investment is the act of redirecting
resources from being consumed today so that they may create
benefits in the future. In more narrow, economic terms, investment
is the use of assets to earn income or profit.
One of the benefits of the free enterprise system is that
it provides investment opportunities. Investment promotes
economic growth and helps to create wealth. When people deposit
money in a savings account in a bank, for example, the bank may
then lend the funds to businesses. The businesses, in turn, may
invest that money in new plants and equipment to give them the
resources to increase production. As these businesses use their

DESCRIBE What role does investment play in
the free enterprise system?
The Financial System
In order for investment to take place, an economy
must have a financial system. A financial system
is the network of structures and mechanisms that
allows the transfer of money between savers and
borrowers.
Financial Assets When people save, they are, in
essence, lending funds to others. Whether they put
cash in a savings account, purchase a certificate
of deposit, or buy a government or corporate bond,
savers obtain a document that confirms their
purchase or deposit. These documents may be
passbooks, monthly statements, bond certificates, or
other records.
Such documents represent claims on the property
or income of the borrower. These claims are called
financial assets, or securities. If the borrower fails
to pay back the loan, these documents can serve as
proof in court that money was borrowed and that
commitments were made that were not fulfilled.Savers and Borrowers Figure 6.7 shows how
the financial system brings together savers and
borrowers, fueling investment and economic growth.
On one side are savers—households, individuals,
and businesses that lend out their savings in return
for financial assets, such as the promise of regular
interest payments.On the other side are investors—governments
and businesses—who invest the money they borrow
to build roads, factories, and homes. Investors may
also use these funds to develop new products, create
new markets, or provide new services.
Interest allocates savings to its most productive
use. The interest that savers earn is the reason why
they save money in a bank or invest it, rather than
spending it or holding cash. Financial institutions
then invest those savings in businesses that use
it productively to create more wealth. Long-term
interest rates are higher than short term rates, which
can also help use money productively. Without the
higher rates, people might not be willing to invest
money for long periods of time. When businesses
can have that money for longer periods, they can
use in productive ways that require more time, such
as building new facilities or investing in equipment
that may take a while to pay off.
CHECK UNDERSTANDING How can a saver
such as an individual, a household, or a business

Analyze Graphs How would you describe the trend in the percentage that Americans saved between 1975 and 2005? Financial Intermediaries Savers and borrowers may be linked directly. As you examine Figure 6.7, you will notice that borrowers and savers may also be linked through a variety of institutions pictured as “in between” the two. These financial intermediaries are institutions that help channel funds from savers to borrowers. They include the following: Banks, savings and loan associations (S&Ls), credit unions, and finance companiesBanks, S&Ls, and credit unions take in deposits from savers and then lend out some of these funds to businesses and individuals. Finance companies make loans to consumers and small businesses. Mutual funds A mutual fund pools the savings of many individuals and invests this money in a variety of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. Mutual funds allow people to invest in a broad range of companies in the stock market. Investing in this way is less risky than purchasing the stock of only one or two companies that might do poorly. Hedge funds A hedge fund is a private investment organization that employs risky strategies that often make huge profits for investors. These investors are generally wealthy and often are knowledgeable about investing. Because hedge funds are private, they have not been regulated by the SEC and have not had to reveal information about themselves to the public. Life insurance companies The main function of life insurance is to provide financial protection for the family or other people named as beneficiaries of the insured. Working members of a family, for example, may buy life insurance policies so that, if they die, money will be paid to survivors to make up for lost income. Insurance companies collect payments called premiums from the people who buy insurance. They lend out to investors part of the premiums that they collect. Pension funds A pension is income that some retirees receive after working a certain number of years or reaching a certain age. In certain cases, injuries may qualify a working person for pension benefits. Employers may set up pension funds in a number of ways. They may contribute to the pension fund on behalf of their employees, they may withhold a percentage of workers&apos; salaries to deposit in a pension fund, or they may do both. Employers set up pension funds to collect deposits and distribute payments. Pension fund managers invest those deposits in stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. Now that you know something about the types of financial intermediaries, you may wonder why savers don&apos;t deal directly with investors. The answer is that, in general, dealing with financial intermediaries 6.5 Investing 265 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="332"> <text><![CDATA[ offers three advantages. Intermediaries share risks, provide information, and provide liquidity. Sharing Risk As a saver, you may not want to invest your entire life savings in a single company or enterprise. For example, if you had $500 to invest and your neighbor was opening a new restaurant, would you give her the entire $500? Since it is estimated that more than half of all new businesses fail, you would be wise not to risk all of your money in one investment. Instead, you would want to spread the money around to various businesses. This would reduce your chances of losing your entire investment. This strategy of spreading out investments to reduce risk is called diversification. If you deposited $500 in the bank or bought shares of a mutual fund, those institutions could pool your money with other people&apos;s savings and put your money to work by making a variety of investments. In other words, financial intermediaries can diversify your investments and thus reduce the risk that you will lose all of your funds if a single investment fails. Financial intermediaries such as banks weigh risks when determining if it will be worthwhile to invest money in a given business venture. They will take a risk if the opportunity merits it. Because financial institutions diversify their investments, they can take risks that individuals would probably be unwilling to take. They can invest a portion of money into a risky venture, because they know that it could be a very profitable and productive use  of the money. Financial intermediaries generally know more than individuals about potential risks and rewards of investments, so these institutions are more likely to invest in ventures that will have a productive outcome. Providing Information Financial intermediaries are also good sources of information. Your local bank collects information about borrowers by monitoring their income and spending. Finance companies collect information when borrowers fill out credit applications. Mutual fund managers know how the stocks in their portfolios, or collections of financial assets, are performing. As required by law, all intermediaries provide this and other information to potential investors in an investment report called a prospectus. The typical prospectus also warns potential investors that “past performance does not necessarily predict future results.” An investment that looks great today may fizzle tomorrow. As economic conditions change, an investment once considered safe may look very risky. By providing vital data about investment opportunities, financial intermediaries reduce the costs in time and money that lenders and borrowers would pay if they had to search out such information on their own. The information, however, is sometimes provided in lengthy documents with small type. So the careful investor must be knowledgeable and must study whatever information has been provided.

    <page pageNumber="333"> <text><![CDATA[ Providing Liquidity Financial intermediaries also provide investors with liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to convert an asset into cash. Suppose, for example, that you decide to invest in a mutual fund. Two years later, you need cash to pay your college tuition. You can get cash quickly by selling your shares in the mutual fund. Other investments are not so liquid. If you had purchased an investment- quality painting instead, you would need to find another investor who would buy the art from you. As you can see, financial intermediaries and the liquidity they provide are crucial to meeting borrowers&apos; and lenders&apos; needs in our increasingly complex financial system. IDENTIfy CENTRAL IDEAS Why do savers and investors generally work through financial intermediaries? Liquidity, Return, and Risk As you have read, most decisions involve trade-offs. For example, the trade-off for not going to a movie may be two additional hours of sleep. Saving and investing involve trade-offs as well. Liquidity and Return Suppose you save money in a savings account. Savings accounts are good ways to save when you need to be able to get to your cash for immediate use. On the other hand, savings accounts pay relatively low interest rates, about 2 to 3 percentage points below a certificate of deposit (CD). In other words, savings accounts are liquid, but they have a low return. Return is the money an investor receives above and beyond the sum of money that has been invested. What if, however, you unexpectedly inherit $5,000? You do not need ready access to those funds, since your part-time job pays your day-to-day expenses. If you are willing to give up some degree of ready access to your money, you can earn a higher interest rate than you would earn if you put the money into a savings account. For example, you can invest your money in a CD that pays 4 percent interest. You would not be allowed to withdraw your money for, say, two years without paying a penalty. Therefore, before buying the CD, you would want to weigh the greater return on your investment against the loss of liquidity. >> Analyze Political Cartoons How does this investment advisor misinterpret the term liquidity? >> Certificates of Deposit provide a greater rate of return than savings accounts. The trade-off is that CDs are not liquid, so investors cannot access their money until the CD matures. 6.5 Investing 267 ]]></text>

When you buy a CD valued at less than $250,000, you are giving up liquidity for a certain period of time, but you are not risking the loss of your money. What if, however, you decided to invest the money in a new company that your friends are starting? You must consider the risk you are now incurring. If the company succeeds, you could double your investment. However, it may take years before it is clear that the company is successful. If it fails, however, you could lose all or part of the money you invested. The government does not insure you against the risk of an investment gone bad. You may benefit from the rewards of a good investment, but you face the risks of a bad one. To take another example, suppose your savings account is earning 2 percent interest. Would you be willing to lend money to your friend Emily for that same 2 percent interest rate, knowing that she rarely pays back loans on time? Probably not. For you to lend Emily the money, she would have to offer you a higher return than the bank could offer. This higher return would help offset the greater risk that Emily will not repay the loan on time&ndash;or that she does not repay the loan at all. Likewise, a large investor, such as a big company, might be willing to pay a higher rate of return on a riskier investment. In this way, the higher return encourages savers to put their money in parts of the economy that might be very productive but are also riskier. Whenever individuals evaluate an investment, they must balance the risks involved with the rewards they expect to gain from the investment. In general, the higher the potential return on an investment, the riskier the investment. Balancing this risk may be exceedingly tricky. Yet it&apos;s important to remember that investors will put their savings into an array of higher-and lower- risk investments while always trying to make the investments solid. By investing in this range, their savings are allocated to their most productive use. As Forbesmagazine has commented: The risk/return tradeoff could easily be called the ‘ability-to-sleep-at-night test.&apos; While some people can handle the equivalent of financial skydiving without batting an eye, others are terrified to climb the financial ladder without a secure harness.

6.6 It is 1942, and the world
is at war. The United States has
thrown all of its resources into
the Allied effort to defeat the Axis
powers. To keep the armed forces
equipped, the government needs
money. To raise that money, the
Treasury Department begins selling
savings bonds.
Bonds and Other
Financial Assets
Bonds as Financial Assets
Americans from every walk of life support the war effort by buying
these “war bonds.” Even though money is tight, you manage to do
your part by bringing a few nickels and dimes to school to buy war
stamps. Added to the money that other students bring, the class
collects enough stamps to buy a bond.
Why are bonds bought and sold? Like the war bonds that
helped finance our effort in World War II, bonds are sold by
governments or corporations to finance projects.
Using the example of a community that needs to construct
a major road, you will see how municipal bonds offer the best
method of financing expensive community projects. You will also
learn another advantage of bonds. They are a type of investment
that usually provides a higher return, but a greater risk, than a
savings account.
Bonds are basically loans, or IOUs, that represent debt that
the seller, or issuer, must repay to an investor. Bonds typically
pay the investor a fixed amount of interest at regular intervals
for a specific amount of time. Bonds are generally lower-risk

As you might expect from your reading about the relationship between risk and return, the rate of return on bonds is usually also lower than for many other investments. The Three Components of Bonds Bonds have three basic components: Coupon rate The coupon rate is the interest rate that a bond issuer will pay to a bondholder. Maturity The time at which payment to a bondholder is due is called the bond&apos;s maturity. The length of time to maturity varies with different bonds. Bonds usually mature in 10, 20, or 30 years. Par value A bond&apos;s par value, assigned by the issuer, is the amount to be paid to the bondholder at maturity. Par value is also called face value or principal. Suppose that you buy a $1,000 bond from the corporation Jeans, Etc. The investor who buys the bond is called the holder. The seller of a bond is the issuer. You are, therefore, the holder of the bond, and Jeans, Etc. is the issuer. The components of this bond are as follows: Coupon rate:5 percent, paid to the bondholder annually Maturity: 10 years Par value: $1,000 How much money will you earn from this bond, and over what period of time? The coupon rate is 5 percent of $1,000 per year. This means that you will receive a payment of $50 (0.05 x $1,000) each year for 10 years, or a total of $500 in interest. In 10 years, the bond will have reached maturity, and the company&apos;s debt to you will have ended. Jeans, Etc. will now pay you the par value of the bond, or $1,000. Thus, for your $1,000 investment, you will have received $1,500 over a period of 10 years. Not all bonds are held to maturity. Over their lifetime they might be bought or sold, and their price may change. Because of these shifts in price, buyers and sellers are interested in a bond&apos;s yield, or yield to maturity. Yield is the annual rate of return on a bond if the bond is held to maturity (5 percent in the earlier example involving Jeans, Etc.). Buying Bonds at a Discount In the free enterprise system, investors earn money from interest on the bonds they buy. They can also earn money by buying bonds at a discount, called a discount from par. In other words, if Nate were buying a bond with a par value of $1,000, he may have to pay only $960 for it. When the bond matures, Nate will redeem the bond at par, or $1,000. He will thus have earned $40 on his investment, in addition to interest payments from the bond issuer. Why would someone sell a bond for less than its par value? The answer lies in the fact that interest rates continually change. For example, suppose that Sharon buys a $1,000 bond at 5 percent interest, the current market rate. A year later, she needs to sell the bond to help pay for a new car. By that time, however, interest rates have risen to 6 percent. No one will pay $1,000 for Sharon&apos;s bond at 5 percent interest when they could go elsewhere and buy a $1,000 bond at 6 percent interest. For Sharon to sell her bond at 5 percent, she will have to sell it at a discount. (See Figure 6.8.) Bond Ratings How does an investor decide which bonds to buy? Investors can check bond quality through independent firms that publish bond issuers&apos; credit ratings. These firms include Standard & Poor&apos;s and Moody&apos;s. They rate bonds on a number of factors, focusing on the issuer&apos;s financial strength&ndash;its ability to make future interest payments and its ability to repay the principal when the bond matures. >> Historically, bond owners cut out coupons that were printed on bonds (shown here) and redeemed the coupons for interest payments. Today, the interest rate is still called the coupon rate. 6.6 Bonds and Other Financial Assets 271 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="338"> <text><![CDATA[ Their rating systems rank bonds from the highest investment grade (AAA in Standard & Poor&apos;s system and AAA in Moody&apos;s) through the lower grades. An investment-grade bond is considered safe enough for banks to invest in. The lowest grade generally means that the bond is in default&ndash;that is, the issuer has not kept up with interest payments or has defaulted on paying principal. The higher the bond rating, the lower the interest rate the company usually has to pay to get people to buy its bonds. For example, an AAA (or “triple A”) bond may be issued at a 5 percent interest rate. A BBB bond, however, may be issued at a 7.5 percent interest rate. The buyer of the AAA bond trades off a lower interest rate for lower risk. The buyer of the BBB bond trades greater risk for a higher interest rate. Similarly, the higher the bond rating, the higher the price at which the bond will sell. For example, a $1,000 bond with an AAA rating may sell at $1,100. A $1,000 bond with a BBB rating may sell for only $950 because of the increased risk that the seller could default. Holders of bonds with high ratings who keep their bonds until maturity face relatively little risk of losing their investment. Holders of bonds with lower ratings, however, take on more risk in return for potentially higher interest payments. Costs and Benefits of Issuing Bonds From the point of view of the investor, bonds are good investments because they are relatively safe. Bonds are desirable from the issuer&apos;s point of view as well, for two main reasons: 1. Once the bond is sold, the coupon rate for that bond will not go up or down. For example, when Jeans, Etc. sells bonds, it knows in advance that it will be making fixed payments for a specific length of time. 2. Unlike stockholders, bondholders do not own a part of the company. Therefore, the company does not have to share profits with its bondholders if the company does particularly well. On the other hand, bonds also pose two main disadvantages to the issuer: 1. The company must make fixed interest payments, even in bad years when it does not make money. In addition, it cannot change its interest payments even when interest rates have gone down. 2. If the firm does not maintain financial health, its bonds may be downgraded to a lower bond rating and, thus, may be harder to sell unless they are offered at a discount.

Analyze Charts Which of these three types of government securities is the most liquid? Bounce to Activate Chart Types of Bonds Despite risks to the issuer, when corporations or governments need to borrow funds for long periods, they often issue bonds. There are several different types of bonds. Savings Bonds You may already be familiar with savings bonds, which are sometimes given to young people as gifts. Savings bonds are low- denomination ($50 to $10,000) bonds issued by the United States government. The government uses funds from the sale of savings bonds to help pay for public works projects such as buildings, roads, and dams. Like other government bonds, savings bonds have virtually no risk of default, or failure to repay the loan. The federal government pays interest on savings bonds. In the past, the rate of interest on savings bonds changed every six months. Since 2005, bonds earn a fixed rate of interest for 30 years, which means that investors can know far in advance what their investment will earn. Treasury Bonds, Bills, and Notes The United States Treasury Department issues Treasury bonds, as well as Treasury bills and notes (T-bills and T-notes). These investments offer different lengths of maturity, as shown in Figure 6.9. Backed by the “full faith and credit” of the United States government, these securities are among the safest investments in terms of default risk. One possible problem with bonds (and investments in general) is inflation. The purchase price and return on Treasury securities are governed by changing interest rates and market conditions. As a result, the value of Treasury securities as an investment must be carefully understood. If a Treasury bond pays you 5 percent interest per year, but the inflation rate is 3 percent, you are really getting just 2 percent interest on the bond. One type of bond issued mainly by the government seeks to protect against inflation&ndash;a general rise in prices. The inflation-indexed bond links the principal and interest to an inflation index&ndash;a measure of how fast prices are rising. If the index rises by 3 percent, this bond&apos;s par value will also rise by 3 percent. As a result, you will receive the return on the bond that you expected when you bought it. Municipal Bonds State and local governments and municipalities (government units with corporate status) issue bonds to finance such projects as highways, state buildings, libraries, parks, and schools. These bonds are called municipal bonds, or “munis.” Because state and local governments have the power to tax, investors can assume that these governments will be able to keep up with interest payments and repay the principal at maturity. Standard & Poor&apos;s and Moody&apos;s therefore consider most municipal bonds to be safe investments. In addition, the interest paid on municipal bonds is not 6.6 Bonds and Other Financial Assets 273 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="340"> <text><![CDATA[ subject to income taxes at the federal level or in the issuing state. Because they are relatively safe and are tax- exempt, “munis” are very attractive to investors as a long-term investment. A high-quality municipal bond can pay a good return for quite a long time. Corporate Bonds As you have already read, corporations issue bonds to help raise money to expand their businesses. These corporate bonds are generally issued in denominations of $1,000 or $5,000. The interest on corporate bonds is taxed as ordinary income. Unlike governments, corporations have no tax base to help guarantee their ability to repay their loans. Thus, these bonds have moderate levels of risk. Investors in corporate bonds must depend on the success of the corporation&apos;s sales of goods and services to generate enough income to pay interest and principal. In the free enterprise system, a corporation often needs to improve and expand its capital resources in order to grow. Using profits is one way to accomplish this, but sometimes a corporation needs more money than their profits can provide. If, for example, it wants to hire more workers, build new offices, or update its equipment, raising money through a bond issue is an option. By making improvements such as these, the corporation can  grow its business substantially and earn more money than it borrows from the bondholders. Corporations that issue bonds are watched closely not only by the independent ratings firms, but also by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is an independent government agency that regulates financial markets and investment companies. It enforces laws prohibiting fraud and other dishonest investment practices. Each bond is issued with an indenture agreement. It sets forth all the features associated with the bond. The interest rate is specified on the indenture agreement. Junk Bonds Bonds with a fairly high risk of default but a potentially high yield are known as junk bonds. These non-investment-grade securities became especially popular investments during the 1980s and 1990s, when large numbers of aggressive investors made&ndash;but also sometimes lost&ndash;large sums of money buying and selling them. Junk bonds have been known to pay more than 12 percent interest at a time when government bonds were yielding only about 8 percent. On the other hand, the speculative nature of most junk bonds makes them very risky. Investors in junk bonds face a strong possibility that some of the issuing firms will default on their debt. Nevertheless, issuing junk bonds has enabled many companies to undertake activities that would otherwise have Average Bond Yields, 2000–2012 Percent yield per year 0 20022000 2001 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 20122008 2009 2010 2011 10 9 6 7 8 4 5 1 2 3 Corporate bond yield 20-year treasury bond yield >> Since 2000, yields for corporate and treasury bonds have dropped significantly.

Junk bond funds, which pool large numbers of individual high-risk bonds, may reduce the risk somewhat for the average investor. Still, investment in junk bond funds can be hazardous. CHECK UNDERSTANDINg Which type of bond might have been used to fund the construction of your school? Other Types of Financial Assets In addition to bonds, investors may choose other financial assets. These include certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds, as well as stock. You will read more about stock later in this Topic. Certificates of Deposit Certificates of deposit (CDs) are one of the most common forms of investment. As you have read, CDs are available through banks, which lend out the funds deposited in CDs for a fixed amount of time, such as six months or two years. CDs are attractive to small investors because they can deposit as little as $100. Investors can also choose among several terms of maturity. This means that if an investor foresees a future expenditure, he or she can buy a CD that matures just before the expenditure is due. Money Market Mutual Funds Money market mutual funds are special types of mutual funds. Financial intermediaries collect money from individual investors and then buy stocks, bonds, or other financial assets to form a mutual fund. In the case of money market mutual funds, intermediaries buy short-term financial assets. Investors receive higher interest on a money market mutual fund than they would receive from a savings account. On the other hand, money market mutual funds are not covered by FDIC insurance. (As you read earlier in this Topic, FDIC insurance protects bank deposits up to $250,000 per account.) This lack of insurance makes them slightly riskier than savings accounts.

    <page pageNumber="342"> <text><![CDATA[ Financial Asset Markets Financial assets, including bonds, certificates of deposit, and money market mutual funds, are traded on financial asset markets. The various types of financial asset markets are classified in different ways. Capital Markets and Money Markets One way to classify financial asset markets is according to the length of time for which funds are lent. This type of classification includes both capital markets and money markets. Capital markets Markets in which money is lent for periods longer than a year are called capital markets. Financial assets that are traded in capital markets include long-term CDs and corporate and government bonds that require more than a year to mature. Money markets Markets in which money is lent for periods of one year or less are called money markets. Financial assets that are traded in money markets include short-term CDs, Treasury bills, and money market mutual funds. Primary and Secondary Markets Markets may also be classified according to whether assets can be resold to other buyers. This type of classification includes primary and secondary markets. Primary markets Financial assets that can be redeemed only by the original holder are sold on primary markets. Examples include savings bonds, which cannot be sold by the original buyer to another buyer. Small certificates of deposit are also in the primary market because investors would most likely cash them in early rather than trying to sell them to someone else. Secondary markets Financial assets that can be resold are sold on secondary markets. This option for resale provides liquidity to investors. If there is a strong secondary market for an asset, the investor knows that the asset can be resold fairly quickly without a penalty, thus providing the investor with ready cash. The secondary market also makes possible the lively trade in stock that is the subject of the next Lesson. CLASSIfy What are two ways of classifying financial asset markets? ASSESSMENT 1.

If you want to know how the stock market works, you will not lack

You have read about how corporations, when they need money
to expand their business, will often borrow it by selling bonds. A
bond carries with it a promise to investors to repay the borrowed
money, with interest. Corporations can also raise funds by issuing
stock, which is a certificate of ownership in a corporation. Unlike
someone who buys a bond, an investor who buys stock in a
corporation becomes a part-owner of that corporation. Stock is
issued in portions known as shares. By selling shares of stock,
corporations raise money to start, run, and expand their businesses.

The higher the profit, the larger the dividend per share of stock. Capital gains A second way an investor can earn a profit is to sell the stock for more than he or she paid for it. The difference between the higher selling price and the lower purchase price is called a capital gain. An investor who sells a stock at a price lower than the purchase price, however, suffers a capital loss. Types of Stock Stock may be classified in several ways, such as whether or not it pays dividends. Income stock By paying dividends, this stock provides investors with regular income. Growth stock This stock pays few or no dividends. Instead, the issuing company reinvests its earnings in its business. The business (and its stock) thus grows in value over time. Stock may also be classified as to whether or not the stockholders have a vote in company policy. Common stock Investors who buy common stock are usually voting owners of the company. They usually receive one vote for each share of stock owned. They may use this vote, for example, to help elect the company&apos;s board of directors. In some cases, a relatively small group of people may own enough shares to give them control over the company. Preferred stock Investors who buy preferred stock are usually nonvoting owners of the company. Owners of preferred stock, however, receive dividends before the owners of common stock. If the company goes out of business, preferred stockholders get their investments back before common stockholders. Stock Splits Owners of common stock may sometimes vote on whether to initiate a stock split. A stock split means that each single share of stock splits into more than one share. A company may seek to split a stock when the price of stock becomes so high that it discourages potential investors from buying it. For example, suppose you own 200 shares in a sporting goods company called Ultimate Sports. Each share is worth $100. After a 2-for-1 split, you own 400 shares of Ultimate Sports, or two shares of stock for every single share you owned before. Because the price is divided along with the stock, however, each share is now worth only $50. Thus a stock split does not immediately result in any financial gain. Shareholders like splits, however, because splits usually demonstrate that the company is doing well, and the lower stock price tends to attract more investors. 50 SHARES$3,000 $60 EACH@ = 100 SHARES$3,000 $30 EACH@ = HOW A STOCK SPLIT WORKS STOCKSPLIT >> A stock split doubles the amount of shares that a stockholder owns.

Analyze Charts Which type of stock shown here is the safest? Risks of Investing in Stock Purchasing stock is risky, because the firm selling the stock may earn lower profits than expected, or it may lose money. If so, the dividends will be smaller than expected or nothing at all, and the market price of the stock will probably decrease. If the price of the stock decreases, investors who choose to sell their stock will get less than they paid for it, experiencing a capital loss. How do the risk and rate of return on stocks compare with the risk and rate of return on bonds? As you have read, investors expect higher rates of return when they take on greater risk. Because of the laws governing bankruptcy, stocks are more risky than bonds. When a firm goes bankrupt, it sells its assets (such as land and equipment) and then pays its creditors, including bondholders, first. Stockholders receive a share of the assets only if there is money left over after bondholders are paid. As you might expect, because stocks are riskier than bonds, the return on stocks is generally higher. RECALL What are two ways to make a profit from investing in a stock? Stock Trading Suppose you decide that you want to buy stock. How do you get started? Do you call up the company and place an order? Probably not, because very few companies sell stock directly. Instead, you would contact a stockbroker, a person who links buyers and sellers of stock. Stockbrokers usually work with individual investors, advising them to buy or sell particular stocks. Stockbrokers work for brokerage firms, or businesses that specialize in trading stocks. Stockbrokers and brokerage firms cover their costs and earn a profit by charging a commission, or fee, on each stock transaction. Sometimes, they also act as dealers of stock, meaning that they buy shares at a lower price and sell them to investors at a slightly higher price, profiting from the difference, or “spread.” Stock Exchanges A market for buying and selling stock is known as a stock exchange. Stock exchanges act as secondary markets for stocks and bonds. That is, stocks and bonds are not sold directly by corporations through the stock exchange but are resold by investors. Most newspapers and many Web sites publish data on transactions in major stock exchanges. (See Figure 6.10 to learn how to 6.7 Stocks 279 ]]></text>

In addition, a large number of people trade stocks on the Internet, using online brokerage firms or special trading software. The ease of this approach also makes it very risky, because snap judgments can often be wrong&ndash;and very costly. New York Stock Exchange The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is probably the country&apos;s best known exchange. The NYSE began in 1792 as an informal, outdoor exchange in New York&apos;s financial district. Over time, as the financial market developed and the demand to buy and sell financial assets grew, the exchange moved indoors and became restricted to a limited number of members who bought “seats” allowing them to trade on the exchange. In 2013, the NYSE was purchased by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) an Atlanta-based company that runs commodities and other types of exchanges around the world. The NYSE handles stock and bond transactions for the top companies in the United States and in the world. The largest, most financially sound, and best-known firms listed on the NYSE are referred to as blue chip companies. Blue chip stocks are often in high demand, because investors expect the companies to continue to do business profitably for a long time. Nasdaq Despite the importance of organized markets like the New York Stock Exchange, many stocks, as well as bonds, are not traded on the floor of stock exchanges. Instead, they are traded directly, on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Using a telephone or the Internet, investors may buy directly from a dealer or broker who will search other dealers or brokers on the OTC market for the best price. The Nasdaq (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation) system was created in 1971 to help organize the OTC market through the use of automation. It grew rapidly in the 1990s, in part by focusing on new-technology stocks. Today, the Nasdaq Stock Market (as it became known) is the second-largest securities market in the country and the largest electronic market for stocks. It handles more trades on average than any other American market. True to its OTC roots, Nasdaq has no physical trading floor. Instead it has a telecommunications network through which it broadcasts trading information to computer terminals throughout the world. Futures and Options Futures are contracts to buy or sell commodities at a particular date in the future at a price specified today. For example, a buyer and seller might agree today on a price of $4.50 per bushel for soybeans that would not reach the market until six or nine months from now. The buyer would pay some portion of the money today, and the seller would deliver the goods in the future.

These markets include the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. Similarly, options are contracts that give investors the choice to buy or sell stock and other financial assets. Investors may buy or sell a particular stock at a particular price up until a certain time in the future&ndash;usually three to six months. The option to buy shares of stock until a specified time in the future is known as a call option. For example, you may pay $10 per share today for a call option. The call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a certain stock at a price of, say, $100 per share. If at the end of six months, the price has gone up to $115 per share, your option still allows you to purchase the stock for the agreed- upon $100 per share. You thus earn $5 per share ($15 minus the $10 you paid for the call option). If, on the other hand, the price has dropped to $80, you can throw away the option and buy the stock at the going rate. The option to sell shares of stock at a specified time in the future is called a put option. Suppose that you, as the seller, pay $5 per share for the right to sell a particular stock that you do not yet own at $50 per share. If the price per share falls to $40, you can buy the share at that price and require the contracted buyer to pay the agreed-upon $50. You would then make $5 per share on the sale ($10 minus the $5 you paid for the put option). If the price rises to $60, however, you can throw away the option and sell the stock for $60. Day Trading Most people who buy stock hold their investment for a significant period of time&ndash; sometimes many years&ndash;with the expectation that it will grow in value. Day traders use a different strategy. They might make dozens of trades per day, sometimes holding a stock for just minutes or even seconds. The typical day trader, sitting in front of a computer, hopes to ride a rising stock&apos;s momentum for a short time and then sell the stock for a quick profit. Day trading is a bit like gambling&ndash;it is a very risky business in which traders can lose a great deal of money. As the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has warned: While day trading is neither illegal nor is it unethical, it can be highly risky.

Tracking Stock Performance You may have heard newscasters speak of a “bull” or “bear” market or of the market rising or falling. What do these terms mean, and how can an investor track increases and decreases in the sale of stocks? Bull and Bear Markets When stock prices in general steadily rise for a period of time, a bull market exists. On the other hand, when stock prices steadily fall or stagnate for a period of time, analysts call it a bear market. In a bull market, >> Large gains on the stock market are often followed by large losses. Analyze Political Cartoons What object in this cartoon symbolizes the stock market? Why did the cartoonist choose it? investors expect an increase in profits and, therefore, buy stock. During a bear market, investors sell stock in expectation of lower profits. The 1980s and 1990s brought the longest sustained bull market in the nation&apos;s history. Between 2000 and 2006, the market went through brief cycles of bear and bull markets. Then general concerns about the economy, and the subprime mortgage crisis, led to a bear market lasting from October 2007 to March 2009. During that time, the stock market lost some 54 percent of its value. After that, a strong bull market developed. Dow Jones Industrial Average When newscasters say “the stock market rose today,” they are often referring to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a measure of stock performance known simply as “the Dow.” The Dow is the average value of a particular set of stocks, and it is reported as a certain number of points. For example, on a good day, the Dow might rise 60 points. The group of stocks listed on the Dow is intended to represent the market as a whole. To make sure it does, some of the stocks are periodically dropped and others added. Today, those stocks represent 30 large, very strong, and influential companies in various industries, such as food, energy, and technology. S&P 500 The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor&apos;s 500) gives a broader picture of stock performance than the Dow. It tracks the price changes of 500 different stocks as a measure of overall stock market performance. The S&P 500 reports mainly on stocks listed on the NYSE, but some of its stocks are traded on the Nasdaq market. DEfINE What do investors tend to do during a bull market? The Great Crash and Beyond Like the 1980s and 1990s, the 1920s saw a long-term bull market. Unfortunately, this period ended in a horrifying collapse of the stock market known as the Great Crash of 1929. The causes of this collapse contain important lessons for investors in the twenty-first century. Investing During the 1920s When President Herbert Hoover took office in 1929, the United States economy seemed to be in excellent shape. 282 TOPIC 6 Money, Banking, and Financial Markets ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="349"> <text><![CDATA[ The booming economy had dramatically changed the lives of Americans. Factories produced a steady stream of consumer products, including washing machines, toasters, and automobiles. The stock market was soaring. In 1925, the market value of all stocks had been $27 billion. By early October 1929, combined stock values had hit $87 billion. Despite widespread optimism about continuing prosperity, there were signs of trouble. A relatively small number of companies and families held much of the nation&apos;s wealth, while many farmers and workers were suffering financially. In addition, many ordinary people went into debt buying consumer goods such as refrigerators and radios&ndash;new and exciting inventions at the time&ndash;on credit. Finally, industries were producing more goods than consumers could buy. As a result, some industries, including the important automobile industry, developed large surpluses of goods, and prices began to slump. Another economic danger sign was the debt that investors were piling up by playing the stock market. The dizzying climb of stock prices encouraged widespread speculation, the practice of making high-risk investments with borrowed money in hopes of getting a big return. Before World War I, only the wealthy had bought and sold shares in the stock market. Now, however, the press was reporting stories of ordinary people making fortunes in the stock market. Small investors thus began speculating in stocks, often with their life savings. One man described how he began speculating in the following way: One day, one of my customers showed me how much money he was making in the market.... I bit with what you folks call ‘hook, line and sinker.&apos; All the money I took in, I put into stocks. The first day of October in 1929 made me feel like I was rich. The stocks I bought had gone up and up.? &ndash;American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers&apos; Project, 1936–1940 To attract less-wealthy investors, stockbrokers encouraged a practice called buying on margin. Buying on margin allowed investors to purchase a stock for only a fraction of its price and borrow the rest from the brokerage firm. The Hoover administration did little to discourage such risky loans. >> In the 1920s, consumers went into debt to buy the latest innovations, including radios like the one advertised here. The Crash By September 3, 1929, the Dow had reached an all-time high of 381 points. The rising stock prices dominated the news. Prices for many stocks soared far above their real values in terms of the company&apos;s earnings and assets. After their peak in September, stock prices began to fall. Some brokers demanded repayment of loans. When the stock market closed on Wednesday, October 23, 1929, the Dow had dropped 21 points in an hour. The next day, worried investors began to sell, and stock prices fell further. Although business and political leaders told the public not to worry about their losses, widespread panic began. By Monday, October 28, 1929, shares of stock were dropping in value to a fraction of what people had paid for them. Investors all over the country were racing to get what was left of their money out of the stock market. On October 29, 1929, forever known as Black Tuesday, a record 16.4 million shares were sold, compared with the average 4 to 8 million shares per day earlier in the year. The Great Crash had begun. In the Wake of the Crash During the bull market that led up to the Crash, about 4 million people had invested in the stock market. Although they were the first to feel the effects of the Crash, eventually 6.7 Stocks 283 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="350"> <text><![CDATA[ the whole country was affected. The Crash was one cause of the Great Depression, in which millions of Americans lost their jobs, homes, and farms. Massive unemployment became the most obvious sign of the deepening depression. By 1933, more than one quarter of the labor force was out of work. Many Americans lost their homes as well as their jobs during the Great Depression. Desperate for shelter, they erected shacks of scrap wood, old tin, and other materials that they could scavenge. As more and more shacks sprang up, they formed shabby little villages. The residents, who blamed their troubles on the policies of President Hoover, called these shantytowns “Hoovervilles.” Mistakes in monetary policy slowed the nation&apos;s recovery. In 1929, the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) had begun limiting the money supply in order to discourage speculation. It continued this policy, even as the economy worsened. With too little money in circulation, individuals and businesses could not spend enough to help the economy improve. Shifting Attitudes Toward Owning Stocks After the Depression, many people saw stocks as risky investments to be avoided. As late as 1980, a relatively small percentage of American households held stock. Gradually, however, attitudes began to change. For one thing, the development of mutual  funds made it easy to own a wide range of stocks. Americans became more comfortable with stock ownership. After a period of very strong growth, stocks crashed again on “Black Monday,” October 18, 1987. The Dow lost 22.6 percent of its value that day&ndash; nearly twice the one-day loss that began the Great Crash of 1929. However, this time the market rebounded on each of the next two days, and the impact on the economy was much less severe. The Fed moved quickly to add liquidity and reduce interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The shock of the 1987 crash wore off quickly. Within two years, the Dow had returned to pre-crash levels. Starting in 1990, stock prices began to soar on the strength of a growing economy and a technology boom. Many people bought stock for the first time, investing heavily in internet-based companies and other new, high-tech enterprises. A so-called dot. com boom raised stock prices of Internet-based securities to wildly unrealistic levels. At the end of the 1990s, almost half of American households owned mutual funds.

In 2001, an economic downturn and the September 11 terrorist attacks further battered the stock market. That same year, the stock market took yet another hit. An enormous energy-trading company named Enron filed for bankruptcy in December after revealing that it had falsely reported profits for several years in order to cover up huge losses. The price of its once high-flying stock fell from $90 per share to less than $1. Soon, several other large firms faced similar financial scandals. In 2002, Congress responded to the scandals with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This legislation was aimed at reforming lax accounting practices. As a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, top corporate leaders now have to verify that financial reports are accurate or face criminal charges. A Market in Turmoil In time, the stock market recovered and reached new heights, boosted by a red-hot real estate market. In October 2006, the Dow passed the 11,700-point mark. It reached 14,000 in 2007. Then, as investors realized the full extent of the subprime mortgage crisis, the stock market again nosedived. By the end of 2008, it had plunged back to the 8,000 range. Trillions of dollars worth of investments were lost, and people saw their retirement savings lose much of their value. Safe investments, such as corporate and municipal bonds, also were badly hit. The financial crisis even caused the collapse of the renowned investment firm Lehman Brothers. Although the stock market slowly recovered, the market turmoil left investors uneasy.

    <page pageNumber="352"> <text><![CDATA[ Florida Topic 6 Quick Study Guide LESSON SUMMARIES Use these lesson summaries, and the longer versions available online, to review the key ideas for each lesson in this topic. Lesson 1: The Role of Money LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.13 Money is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Money is durable, portable, divisible, and uniform. The supply of money must be limited, and it must be acceptable as payment. Commodity money has the value of the commodity it contains. Representative money has the value of an object for which it can be exchanged. Fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, has value because the government declares it valuable. Lesson 2: Changes in American Banking SS.912.E.2.3, SS.912.E.2.10 The United States once alternated between centralized banking and decentralized banking, which brought instability. After a 1907 bank run&ndash;when many people tried to withdraw money and banks failed&ndash;the U.S. government set up the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) to regulate banks and the money supply. The Great Depression brought more regulation. Since deregulation in the 1970s and 1980s, the country has faced financial crises. Lesson 3: The Federal Reserve System LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.2.10 Over time, the Fed has gained independence and power. It is controlled by a Board of Governors led by a chairperson, all appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. It serves as a banker and issuer of currency for the government, and regulates the nation&apos;s banks and money supply. Lesson 4: The Functions of Modern Banks SS.912.E.1.13, SS.912.E.1.16 The money supply consists of currency and money in bank accounts and deposits. Different kinds of financial services, including banks, provide a variety of services such as letting people save or borrow money. To take advantage of financial services, consumers need to budget to make sure that their expenses do not exceed their income. Lesson 5: Investing SS.912.E.1.14, SS.912.E.1.15 Investment is putting aside resources to create benefits in the future rather than consuming them today. The financial system&ndash;made up of financial intermediaries such as banks and mutual funds&ndash;transfers money between savers or investors and borrowers or investments. Potential returns on investments depend on liquidity, which tends to limit returns, and on risk, which may increase returns at the cost of possible loss. Lesson 6: Bonds and Other Financial Assets SS.912.E.1.15 Bonds are loans with an interest rate&ndash;or yield&ndash;that borrowers must repay, along with the original loan, at the end of a fixed term. Governments and corporations issue bonds. Besides bonds, investors may put money into certificates of deposit with banks, or money market mutual funds. Investments are traded on markets. Lesson 7: Stocks SS.912.E.1.15 Stock is a share of ownership of a corporation. People invest in stock hoping for a gain in value or for dividends&ndash;meaning a share of profits. They face the risk that it will fall in value and they will lose money. Stock is traded on exchanges. Stocks have risen and fallen in value over time, with sharp drops during financial crises. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="355"> <text><![CDATA[ DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTIONS LAFS.1112.RH.3.7 In the early 2000s, investor confidence in the stock market was shaken by a series of scandals. To restore the faith of investors, Congress passed a series of laws to regulate corporate accounting practices. Today, many people continue to support increased government regulation of financial markets. Others believe that government regulation has been harmful to financial markets and the economy in general. DOCUMENT A A Democratic Senator gave a speech in 2015 calling for stronger financial regulations. [W]ithout some basic rules and accountability, financial markets don&apos;t work. People get ripped off, risk-taking explodes, and the markets blow up. That&apos;s just an empirical fact – clearly observable in 1929 and again in 2008. The point is worth repeating because, for too long, the opponents of financial reform have cast this debate as an argument between the pro-regulation camp and the pro-market camp, generally putting Democrats in the first camp and Republicans in the second. But that so-called choice gets it wrong. Rules are not the enemy of markets. Rules are a necessary ingredient for healthy markets, for markets that create competition and innovation. And rolling back the rules or firing the cops can be profoundly anti-market. &ndash;Senator Elizabeth Warren, “The Unfinished Business of Financial Reform” DOCUMENT B A Republican member of the United States Congress expresses a different viewpoint on increased regulation of financial markets. The long-term impact of increasing strict rules and regulations can be just as damaging as fraud and manipulation that occurs in an open system&ndash;probably more so. The increase of rules and regulation adds costs and administrative effort. In effect, companies face disincentives to engage in fair and honest activity. Thus, overregulation is also a destructive activity. &ndash;U.S. Representative Jeff Flake, Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition DOCUMENT C This cartoon expresses one point of view about government regulation of financial markets. 22. The author of which document would be most likely to agree with the following statement: “In order to limit harm to others, stricter regulation is needed”? A. Document A only B. Document B only C. Documents A and C D. Documents B and C 23. Document C supports the idea that regulation of financial markets A. is a necessary evil. B. places too heavy burden on businesses. C. requires up-to-date technology in order to work. D. is the responsibility of the federal government. 24. The authors of Documents A and B disagree about whether A. stricter financial regulation is needed. B. executives should be punished for fraud. C. regulation has much impact. D. competitive markets are key to the economy. 25. Writing Task Evaluate the three perspectives on government regulation presented here.

Economists have developed many tools to monitor the nation’s
economic performance. They even have a way to measure how
much money families like yours have to spend. You will learn what
these measures tell us—and don’t tell us—about the economy.
Economists use a system called national income
accounting to monitor the U.S. economy. They collect and
organize macroeconomic statistics on production, income,
investment, and savings. The Department of Commerce then
presents these data in the form of National Income and Product
Accounts (NIPA). The government uses NIPA data to determine
economic policies.
What is GDP? The most important measure in NIPA is gross
domestic product (GDP), which is the dollar value of all final
goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a given

To help you understand GDP, let us examine each part of this definition: Dollar value refers to the total cash value of the sales of all goods and services produced in a country&apos;s households, firms, and government in a calendar year. Since different quantities of goods such as oranges, computers, and movie tickets are sold at different prices, economists figure out the average prices of these items and the total number sold during the year. These cash figures are then used to calculate GDP. Final goods and services are products in the form sold to consumers. They differ from intermediate goods, which are products used in the production of final goods. The memory chips that a computer maker buys to put into its machines are intermediate goods; the computer is a final good. Produced within a country&apos;s borders is especially important to remember. Because we are trying to find the country&apos;s gross domesticproduct, we can look only at the goods and services produced within that country. For example, the GDP of the U.S. economy includes cars made in Ohio by a Japanese car company but not cars made in Brazil by an American automaker. In a given year takes into account when a good was produced. Suppose your neighbor sells you his used car. When the car was originally made, it was counted in the GDP of that year. Thus, it would be inaccurate to count it toward GDP again this year when it was resold. The Expenditure Approach Government economists calculate GDP two ways. In one method, they use the expenditure approach, sometimes called the output-expenditure approach. First, economists estimate the annual expenditures, or amounts spent, on four categories of final goods and services: 1. consumer goods and services 2. business goods and services 3. government goods and services 4. net exports Two of these categories need explanation. First, bear in mind that consumer goods include two kinds of goods. They are durable goods&ndash;those that last for a relatively long time, such as refrigerators and DVD players&ndash;and nondurable goods&ndash;those that last a short period of time, such as food, light bulbs, and sneakers. Net exports are found by adding up exports&ndash; goods produced in the country but purchased in other countries&ndash;and then subtracting imports. Imports, of course, were produced in another country. After finding the value of those four categories, economists add them together to arrive at the total $ EXPENDITURE APPROACH $ Suppose an economy’s entire output is
cars and trucks.

    <page pageNumber="362"> <text><![CDATA[ expenditures on goods and services produced during the year. This total equals GDP. Figure 7.1 provides a simplified example of calculating GDP with the expenditure approach. The Income Approach The second method to calculate GDP, known as the income approach, is shown in Figure 7.2. This method calculates GDP by adding up all the incomes in the economy. The rationale for this approach is that when a firm sells a product or service, the selling price minus the dollar value of goods and services purchased from other firms represents income for the firm&apos;s owners and employees. Suppose your neighbor bought a newly built house for $200,000. That $200,000 (minus what the builder spent on lumber, plaster, etc.) is income shared by all of the people who helped build and sell the house&ndash;including the contractor, the bricklayer, the roofers, and the real estate broker. Each of these people may get only a small share of the house&apos;s selling price. However, if we added up all those shares, we would arrive at $200,000 (minus what the builder spent on lumber, plaster, etc.) worth of income generated by the sale. This same logic holds for all goods and services. Thus, we may calculate GDP by adding up all income earned in the economy. In theory, calculating GDP with the income approach and the expenditure approach should give us the same total. In fact, there are usually differences because of errors in the underlying data. Economists who work in the federal government take those differences into account. They first determine GDP using both approaches. Then they compare the two totals and make adjustments to offset the differences. This gives them a more accurate result. EXPLAIN Why are imports not included in gross domestic product? Two Measures of GDP Government officials use gross domestic product to find out how well the economy is performing. To help them understand what is really going on in the economy, economists distinguish between two measures of GDP, nominal and real. Calculating Nominal GDP In Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2, we calculated nominal GDP&ndash;that is, GDP measured in current prices. Because it is based 1 Suppose an economy&apos;s entire output is cars and trucks. All employed citizens would work in the car and truck industry or its suppliers. The combined selling price of all the cars and trucks would reflect the money paid to all the people who helped build the vehicles. The economy&apos;s GDP for this year would be the sum of the income of all working citizens, or $350,000. 2 3 4 Engineers Designers Planners Assembly-line workers Managers Suppliers (metal, glass, etc.) +++++ COMBINED INCOME = $350,000 INCOME APPROACH >> Figure 7.2 The income approach, which adds up all the incomes in the economy, is generally more accurate than the expenditure approach.

Nominal GDP for Year 2 is $444,000, but this sum includes price increases. Economists prefer a measure of GDP that is not affected by price changes. Economists establish constant prices by choosing one year as a base year. To correct for an increase in prices, we calculate real GDP for Year 2 using Year 1 prices: Real GDP for Year 2, therefore, is $420,000, showing an increase of $70,000 in real dollars over the previous year.

This year the economy produces: Nominal GDP for Year 1 is $350,000. YEAR 1: NOMINAL GDP >> Figure 7.3 Although nominal GDP offers useful information, real GDP corrects for increases in prices. Analyze Charts What is the difference between nominal and real GDP for Year 2? on current prices, this type of GDP is also called “current GDP.” To calculate nominal GDP, we simply use the current year&apos;s prices to calculate the value of the current year&apos;s output. Figure 7.3 shows how the definition of nominal GDP applies to the small economy that produces only cars and trucks. Calculating Real GDP The data in Figure 7.3 reveal a problem with nominal GDP. The GDP of Year 2 is higher than that of Year 1 even though the output of cars and trucks in the two years is the same. The difference is due to an increase in prices. As a result of these price increases, the higher GDP figure in the second year is misleading. To correct for this distortion, economists determine real GDP, which is GDP expressed in constant, or unchanging, prices. Look at the third section of Figure 7.3. Notice that GDP in Year 2 is based on the prices from Year 1. By using real GDP, economists can discover whether an economy is actually producing more goods and services, regardless of changes in the prices of those items. In Figure 7.3, we can quickly see that output did not increase in Year 2. IDENTIFY What problem is solved by using real GDP? What GDP Doesn&apos;t Measure Even though GDP is a valuable tool, it is not a perfect yardstick. For instance, GDP does not take into account certain economic activities or aspects of life. These include nonmarket activities, the underground economy, negative externalities, and quality of life. Nonmarket Activities GDP does not measure goods and services that people make or do themselves, such as caring for children, mowing the lawn, cooking dinner, or washing the car. GDP does rise, however, when people pay someone else to do these things for them. When these nonmarket activities are shifted to the market, GDP goes up, even though production has not really increased. The Underground Economy A large amount of production and income is never recorded or reported to the government. For instance, transactions on the black market&ndash;the market for illegal goods&ndash;are not counted. Income from illegal gambling goes unreported. So do “under the table” wages that some companies pay workers to avoid paying business and income taxes. Many legal, informal transactions are also not reported, for example, selling your bike to a friend or 7.1 Gross Domestic Product 297 ]]></text>

baby-sitting, mowing lawns, or shoveling snow,
those payments are not included in the GDP either,
even though goods and services were produced and
income was earned.
Negative Externalities Unintended economic side
effects, or externalities, have a monetary value that
often is not reflected in GDP. For example, a power
plant that emits smoke and dust is polluting the air.
That negative result is not subtracted from GDP.
Quality of Life Although some economists and
politicians interpret rising GDP as a sign of rising
well-being, we should remember that additional
goods and services do not necessarily make people
any happier. In fact, some things that are not
counted in GDP contribute greatly to most people’s
quality of life, such as pleasant surroundings, ample
leisure time, and personal safety.
All of these limitations suggest that GDP is a
somewhat flawed measure of output and income and
doesn’t fully measure the personal well-being of all.
Nevertheless, while the measure may be imperfect,
when calculated consistently over a period of time,
GDP helps reveal economic growth rates. For this
reason, economists and policymakers closely watch
the nation’s GDP.SYNTHESIZE Cleaning your house is an

Other Economic Measures
As you have read, our system of National Income and
Product Accounts provides numerous measurements
of the performance of the nation’s economy. While
gross domestic product is the primary measure of
income and output, economists also look at other
measures to focus on specific parts of the economy.
Many of these other yardsticks are derived from GDP.
Figure 7.4 shows how GDP is used to determine five
other economic measures.
The first is gross national product (GNP),
the annual income earned by a nation’s firms and
citizens. GNP is a measure of the market value of all
goods and services produced by Americans in one
year. Study the chart to see how GNP is related to
GDP.
GNP does not account for depreciation, or the
loss of the value of capital equipment that results
from normal wear and tear. The cost of replacing this
physical capital slightly reduces the value of what
we produce. GNP minus the cost of depreciation

NNP measures the net output for one year, or the output made after the adjustment for depreciation. Once they have calculated NNP, government economists adjust their figures to account for minor discrepancies between different sources of data. After making these minor adjustments to NNP, they get another measure, called national income (NI). From NI, we can find out how much pretax income businesses actually pay to U.S. households. This is found by subtracting the profits that firms reinvest in the business and the income taxes and Social Security taxes they pay out. What remains is called personal income (PI). Finally, we want to know how much money people actually have to spend after they pay theirtaxes, a figure called disposable personal income (DPI). To find DPI, we take personal income and subtract individual income and Social Security taxes. See how far we have come? Beginning with GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in a year, we wind up knowing how much cash Americans have to spend or put in the bank. DESCRIBE What is disposable personal income? Factors That Affect GDP So far, we have defined GDP, calculated it, and learned about its limitations. One important issue remains, however: What influences GDP? That is, in a real economy, what factors can make GDP go up or down? These questions go to the heart of macroeconomics. Aggregate Supply As you read earlier, market supply is the amount of a particular good or service available for purchase at all possible prices in an individual market. But how do we look at supply and prices on a macroeconomic level? Think of aggregate supply as a supply curve for the whole economy. First, economists add up the total supply of goods and services produced for sale in the economy&ndash;in other words, GDP. Then they calculate the price level, the average of all prices in the economy. Now they can determine aggregate supply, the total amount of goods and services in the economy available at all possible price levels. In a nation&apos;s economy, as the prices of most goods and services change, the price level changes. Firms Aggregate Supply Price level AS Real GDP >> Figure 7.5 Analyze Graphs What does the positive slope of the graph mean? respond by changing their output. For example, if the price level rises, which means that the prices of most goods and services are rising, firms have an incentive to increase their output. Similarly, as prices throughout the economy fall, companies&apos; profits shrink. In response, they reduce output. You can see this effect in the aggregate supply (AS) curve in Figure 7.5. As the price level rises, real GDP, or aggregate supply, rises. As the price level falls, real GDP falls. Aggregate Demand Aggregate demand is the amount of goods and services in the economy that will be purchased at all possible price levels. As price levels in the economy move up and down, individuals and businesses change how much they buy&ndash;in the opposite direction that aggregate supply changes. For example, a lower price level translates into greater purchasing power for households, because the real value of money rises as price levels drop. The dollars that we hold are worth more at lower price levels than they are at higher price levels. Therefore, falling prices increase wealth and demand. This scenario is called the wealth effect. On the other hand, as the price level rises, purchasing power declines, causing a reduction in the quantity of goods and services demanded. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows this 7.1 Gross Domestic Product 299 ]]></text>

As you can see from Figure 7.6, this curve is
negatively sloped; that is, it moves downward to
the right. Consumers account for most of aggregate
demand, but business spending on capital
investment, government spending, and foreigners’
demand for export goods all play roles, too.
Aggregate Supply/Aggregate Demand
Equilibrium When we put together the aggregate
supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) curves, we
can find the AS/AD equilibrium in the economy as a
whole. Look at Figure 7.7. The intersection of the AS
and AD curves indicates an equilibrium price level
of P1 and an equilibrium real GDP of Q1.
Now consider how GDP might change. Any
shift in either the AS or AD curve will cause real
GDP to change. For example, the graph shows
aggregate demand falling from line AD1 to line AD2.
As a result, the equilibrium GDP (Q2) falls, and so
does the equilibrium price level (P2). Any shift in
aggregate supply or aggregate demand will have an
impact on real GDP and on the price level. In the next
Lesson, we will discuss some factors that may cause
such shifts.

Business Cycle Phases
The national economy undergoes periodic cycles of good times,
then bad times, and then good times again. Recognizing this
pattern, economists try to predict what the economy will do in
the future—what can be done to make the good times last longer
and keep the bad times brief. You will learn what factors affect
these ups and downs and how they have shaped the country’s
economy. You will also see how the actions of ordinary consumers
and borrowers can affect the phases of the economy and how long
these phases last.
A business cycle is a period of macroeconomic expansion
followed by a period of macroeconomic contraction. Economists
also call these periods of change “economic fluctuations.”
Business cycles are not minor, day-to-day ups and downs. They
are major changes in real gross domestic product above or below
normal levels. As you can see in Figure 7.8, the typical business
cycle consists of four phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and
trough.
Expansion An expansion is a period of economic growth
as measured by a rise in real GDP. To economists, economic
growth is a steady, long-term increase in real GDP. In the
expansion phase, jobs are plentiful, the unemployment rate falls,
and businesses prosper.>> An oil drilling boom in North Dakota is an

    <page pageNumber="368"> <text><![CDATA[ Peak When real GDP stops rising, the economy has reached its peak, the height of an economic expansion. Contraction After reaching its peak, the economy enters a period of contraction, an economic decline marked by falling real GDP. Falling output generally causes unemployment to rise. Trough When the economy has “bottomed out,” it has reached the trough (trawf), the lowest point in an economic contraction. At that point, real GDP stops falling and a new period of expansion begins. During a contraction, GDP is always falling. But other economic conditions, such as price levels and the unemployment rate, may vary. Economists have created terms to describe contractions with different characteristics and levels of severity. They include: Recession If real GDP falls for two consecutive quarters (at least six straight months), the economy is said to be in a recession. A recession is a prolonged economic contraction. Generally lasting from 6 to 18 months, recessions are typically marked by unemployment reaching the range of 6 percent to 10 percent. Depression If a recession is especially long and severe, it may be called a depression. The term has no precise definition but usually refers to a deep recession with features such as high unemployment and low economic output. Stagflation This term combines parts of stagnant&ndash;a word meaning “unmoving” or  “decayed”&ndash;and inflation. Stagflation is a decline in real GDP (output) combined with a rise in the price level (inflation). Although economists know much about business cycles, they cannot predict how long the phases in a particular cycle will last. The only certainty is that a growing economy will eventually experience a downturn, and that a contracting economy will eventually bounce back. INTERPRET If real GDP has fallen for three consecutive quarters, and the unemployment rate is nearing 10 percent, what period of economic fluctuation is the economy in? What Drives Business Cycles? The shifts that occur during a business cycle have many causes, some more predictable than others. Often, two or more factors will combine to push the economy into the next phase of a business cycle. Typically, a sharp rise or drop in some important economic variable will set off a series of events that bring about the next phase. Business cycles are affected by four main economic variables: 1. business investment 2. interest rates and credit 3. consumer expectations 4. external shocks Tracking a Business Cycle ExpansionExpansionExpansion Peak Peak Peak ContractionContraction Tr ough Tr ough Increasing employment, income, and general prosperity Dwindling business activity; unemployment >> Figure 7.8 Analyze Information What is the point of slowest business activity in a business cycle called?

    <page pageNumber="369"> <text><![CDATA[ Why Businesses Make Investments When the economy is expanding, businesses might expect to increase the goods or services they produce. Therefore, they may invest heavily in building new plants and buying new equipment. Or they may invest in the expansion of old plants in order to increase the plants&apos; productive capacity. All of this business investment spending creates additional output and jobs, helping to increase GDP and maintain the expansion. At some point, however, firms may decide that they have expanded enough or that demand for their products is dropping. They cut back on investment spending; as a result, aggregate demand falls. The result is a decline in GDP and also in the price level. The drop in business spending reduces output and income in other sectors of the economy. When that occurs, industries that produce capital goods slow their own production and begin to lay off workers. Other industries might follow, causing overall unemployment to rise. Jobless workers cannot buy new cars, eat at restaurants, or perhaps even pay their rent. If the downward spiral picks up speed, a recession results. The Cost of Credit In the United States economy, consumers often use credit to purchase “big ticket” items&ndash;from new cars and houses to home electronics and vacations. The cost of credit is the interest rate that financial institutions charge their customers. If the interest rate rises, consumers are less likely to buy those new cars and appliances. Consumers who do purchase items using credit cards can find themselves paying much more for the items they buy because high interest rates and fees increase the cost. Businesses, too, look to interest rates in deciding whether or not to purchase new equipment, expand their facilities, or make many other large investments. When interest rates are low, companies are more willing to borrow money. When interest rates climb, business borrowing falls. One result of rising interest rates, then, is less output. Such a result may lead to a contraction phase. Consider one example of the impact of interest rates on the business cycle. In the early 1980s, high consumer interest rates helped bring on the worst economic slump in the United States since the Great Depression. Some credit card interest rates reached 21 percent. As a result, the cost of expensive items usually purchased using credit was too high for many Americans. With reduced consumer spending, the economy entered a recession that pushed >> In a downturn, consumers may have a harder time with credit card debt. Analyze Political Cartoons Why does the cartoonist portray the man as looking so nervous? unemployment rates over 9 percent&ndash;the highest since the Depression. Expectations Affect Spending Consumer spending is determined partly by consumers&apos; expectations. If people expect the economy to begin contracting, they may reduce their spending because they expect layoffs and lower incomes. This reduced spending can actually help bring on a contraction, as firms respond to reduced demand for their products. Thus consumer expectations often become self-fulfilling prophecies, creating the very outcome that consumers fear. In the summer of 2007, consumer confidence fell. By September, consumer confidence was the lowest it had been in two years. This low level of consumer confidence affected the holiday shopping season at the end of the year. High consumer confidence has the opposite effect on the economy. If people expect a rapidly growing economy, they will also expect abundant job opportunities and rising incomes. Thus, they will buy more goods and services, pushing up gross domestic product. Effects of External Shocks Of all the factors that affect the business cycle, perhaps most difficult to predict are external shocks. External shocks can 7.2 Business Cycles 303 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="370"> <text><![CDATA[ dramatically affect an economy&apos;s aggregate supply. Examples of negative external shocks include disruptions of the oil supply, wars that interrupt trade, and droughts that severely reduce crop harvests. Let&apos;s consider what might happen if a shock occurred. Suppose that the nation&apos;s supply of imported oil was suddenly cut off. Immediately, the price of any remaining oil would skyrocket. This rapid increase would have a powerful ripple effect on the economy. Oil is used to produce many goods, and petroleum products fuel the trucks, trains, and airplanes that transport goods from factories to stores. The oil shortage and high prices would force firms to reduce production and raise prices. In other words, GDP declines and the price level rises. This economic condition is particularly harmful to businesses and households, and is difficult for policymakers to fix. Of course, an economy may also enjoy positive external shocks. The discovery of a large deposit of oil or minerals will contribute to a nation&apos;s wealth. A growing season with a perfect mix of sun and rain may create bountiful harvests that drive food prices down. Positive shocks tend to shift the Aggregate Supply curve to the right, lowering the price level and increasing real GDP. >> When the business cycle that brought expansion in the 1920s began to contract, the Great Depression followed. External shocks usually come without much warning. The other key factors capable of pushing an economy from one phase of the business cycle to another are more predictable. So economists track business investment, interest rates, and consumer expectations in order to more accurately forecast new stages of the business cycle. INFER A major thunderstorm destroyed Midland Farm&apos;s summer crop of corn, greatly affecting the business&apos;s overall profits. What type of economic variable would this storm be considered? Forecasting Business Cycles Predicting changes in a business cycle is difficult. For example, in the summer of 1929, John J. Raskob, Senior Financial Officer of General Motors, declared his firm belief that the United States was on the verge of the greatest industrial expansion in its history. In my opinion the wealth of the country is bound to increase at a very rapid rate . . . . Anyone who believes that opportunities are now closed and that from now on the country will get worse instead of better is welcome to the opinion&ndash;and whatever increment it will bring. I think that we have scarcely started . . . . I am firm in my belief that anyone not only can be rich but ought to be rich. &ndash;John Jakob Raskob, interview in the Ladies Home Journal,August 1929 Less than two months later, the stock market crashed, setting off the worst depression in American history. Economists today know a lot more about the workings of our economy than Raskob did in 1929. However, economic predictions are still tricky. To predict the next phase of a business cycle, forecasters must anticipate movements in real GDP before they occur. This is no easy task, given the large number of factors that influence the level of output in a modern economy. Government and business decision makers need economic predictions to be accurate, however, so they can respond properly to changes in a business 304 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Economists have many tools available for making
these predictions. The leading indicators are a set
of key economic variables that provide economists
with economic data to predict future trends in a
business cycle, but as you can see in Figure 7.9
many factors can contribute to a recession.
The stock market is one leading indicator.
Typically, the stock market turns sharply downward
before a recession begins. For example, the crash
of the Nasdaq exchange in 2000 preceded the
recession of 2001. Interest rates are another indicator.
As you have seen, interest rates have a strong effect
on consumer and business spending.
The Conference Board, a private business
research organization, maintains an index of
economic data from the ten leading economic
indicators, including stock prices, interest rates,
and manufacturers’ new orders of capital goods.
Economists and policymakers closely watch this
index, which is updated monthly. However, like the
other important tools used to forecast changes in the
business cycle, it is not altogether reliable.IDENTIFY What do the stock market and interest
rates have in common? Business Cycles in the
United States
Economic activity in the United States has indeed
followed a cyclical pattern. Periods of GDP growth
alternate with periods of GDP decline.
The Great Depression As you read earlier, before
the 1930s many economists believed that when an
economy declined, it would quickly recover on its
own. This explains why, when the U.S. stock market
crashed in 1929, and the economy took a nosedive,
President Herbert Hoover felt little need to change
his economic policies.
However, the Great Depression did not rapidly
cure itself. Rather, it was the most severe economic
downturn in the history of industrial capitalism. As
Figure 7.10 indicates, the effects went beyond the
United States. Between 1929 and 1933, GDP fell by
about a quarter, and unemployment rose sharply.
In fact, one out of every four American workers was
jobless, and those who could find work often earned
very low wages.
As the effects of the Great Depression spread
throughout the world, it affected economists’ beliefs
about the macroeconomy. The Depression, along
with the publication of John Maynard Keynes’s
The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and
Money, pushed economists to consider the idea that 7.2 Business Cycles 305]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="372"> <text><![CDATA[modern market economies could fall into long-lasting
contractions. In addition, many economists accepted
Keynes’s idea that government intervention might be
needed to pull an economy out of a depression. You
will read more about Keynes and his ideas later in
this course.
The Depression also affected American politics.
Rejecting Hoover, voters in 1932 elected the
Democratic governor of New York, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, to the presidency. Roosevelt soon began
a series of government programs, known as the New
Deal, designed to get people back to work.
Programs such as the Works Progress
Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps
got able-bodied workers back on the job and earning
income, which they then spent supporting their
families. In this way, spending increased throughout
the economy.
Still, although the New Deal relieved some of
the effects of hard times, it did not end the Great
Depression. Not until the United States entered into
World War II did the economy achieve full recovery.
The sudden surge in government defense spending
boosted real GDP well above pre-Depression levels.
More Recent Recessions Thankfully, no
economic downturns since the 1930s have been
nearly as severe as the Great Depression. We have
had recessions, though In the 1970s, an international cartel, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), placed an embargo on oil shipped to the
United States and quadrupled the price of its
oil. These actions caused external shocks in the
American oil market. As oil prices skyrocketed,
raw material costs rose, and the economy quickly
contracted into a period of stagflation.
Reeling from higher-than-ever prices for gasoline
and heating fuel, Americans began looking for ways
to conserve energy. They turned down their heat;
bought smaller, more fuel-efficient cars; and began
researching energy alternatives to petroleum. When
the United States and other nations developed more
of their own energy resources, OPEC finally lowered
its oil prices.
As you read earlier, there was another
recession in the early 1980s. High interest rates
and other factors caused real GDP to fall and the
unemployment rate to rise to over 9 percent in the
early 1980s.
Following a brief recession in 1991, the U.S.
economy grew steadily, with real GDP rising each
year during the 1990s. The country enjoyed record
growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. Some
economists began to suggest that the nature of the
business cycle had changed. Perhaps we had learned
how to control recessions and promote long-term
growth. Effects of the Great Depression Percentage unemployed

Explain your answer. Much of this growth was fueled by the rise of Internet companies, called “dot.coms,” after part of their Internet address. As the dot.com boom of the 1990s ended, however, U.S. economic growth slowed. Businesses and individuals invested billions of dollars in new technology that proved to be unprofitable and, in some cases, worthless. The negative effects of the technology crash spread throughout the economy to other industries. In March 2001, the country slipped into a recession. Economists hoped this decline would prove short- lived, but then the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, resulted in a sharp drop in consumer spending. The hotel, airline, and tourism industries were especially affected. Many companies blamed their performance problems on September 11. The Present-Day Business Cycle The recession ended in November 2001 when the economy began to grow slowly. Historically low interest rates prevented the economy from slipping back into a recession. However, unemployment continued to rise steadily over the following years as companies laid off more workers and kept spending low. Growth was not strong enough to dispel the feeling of bad times even though the recession had ended. The economy did recover, though. By late 2003, it was surging, with GDP growing at an annual rate of 7.5 percent over three months. After that, growth slowed, though it did continue. High gasoline prices in 2006 caused the economy&apos;s growth to slow even further. Difficulties in the home mortgage market spiraled into a financial crisis and economic recession in 2008. In the following years the economy improved slowly, though the unemployment rate remained high.

He put in place a series of government programs known as the New Deal. The goal of these programs was to help struggling Americans and to boost the economy. In 1940, Roosevelt ran as a Democrat for re-election to a third term. A key issue in the campaign was the New Deal. Thomas and Doris Reed published a summary of Republican positions in May 1940. Roosevelt responded in a speech in Brooklyn in November 1940.  The Republican Opposition: Thomas H. Reed and Doris D. Reed . . . The Republican offensive is directed not at the social objectives of the New Deal but at the economic measures by which the Roosevelt Administration has wooed recovery.

The spearhead of the Republican attack is aimed at the spending, borrowing, taxing, and business regulating policies of the Roosevelt Administration. . . . The program committee devotes a long section of its report to what it calls New Deal defeatism. It finds “that the private economy of America has not come to a dead end . . . but is crowded with possibilities of fruitful growth and profitable expansion.” Candidate Dewey has made the defeatist attitude of the New Deal the theme of several speeches.

It is the poor who will be cared for by a solvent government. It is the poor who will suffer most when the government goes into bankruptcy.” . . .

and a car. Clearly, as far as material
possessions go, Americans of your
generation are generally much better
off today than they were 100 years
ago. The biggest reason is economic
growth. Economic Growth
Measuring Economic Growth
Economic growth allows successive generations to have more
and better goods and services than their parents had. Economic
growth enables an entire society to make major improvements in
its quality of life.
The basic measure of a nation’s economic growth rate is
the percentage of change in real GDP over a period of time. For
example, real GDP in 1996 was $8.3 trillion, and in 2006, it was
$11.3 trillion. The economic growth rate for this decade was about
36 percent ($11.3 trillion – $8.3 trillion) ÷ $8.3 trillion x 100).
GDP and Population Growth To satisfy the needs of a growing
population, real GDP must grow at least as fast as the population
does. This is one reason that economists prefer a measure that
takes population growth into account. For this, they rely on
real GDP per capita, which is real GDP divided by the total
population of a country (per capitameans “for each person”).
Figure 7.11 shows growth in real GDP per capita.
Real GDP per capita is considered the most accurate measure
of a nation’s standard of living. As long as real GDP is rising faster
than the population, real GDP per capita will rise, and so will the
standard of living. Economists can see how the standard of living
has changed over time by comparing real GDP per capita from two Savvas.com/FloridaSS

GDP and Quality of Life GDP measures standard of living, which relates to material goods. We cannot use it, however, to measure people&apos;s quality of life. GDP excludes many factors that affect the quality of life, such as the state of the environment or the level of stress people feel in their daily lives. In addition, while real GDP per capita represents the average output per person in an economy, it tells us nothing about how that output is distributed across the population. There are a number of ways that economists measure how income is distributed in the United States, such as “personal income distribution” and “functional income distribution.” These measures, while complicated, are important. If most of the income in a nation goes to relatively few people while the majority earn next to nothing, the typical person will not enjoy a very high standard of living even if the real GDP per capita figure is high. Despite these facts, real GDP per capita is a good starting point for measuring a nation&apos;s quality of life. People who live in nations with greater availability of goods and services usually enjoy better nutrition, safer and more comfortable housing, lower infant mortality, longer life spans, better education, greater job opportunities, and other indicators of a favorable quality of life. Since economic growth has an enormous impact on quality of life, economists devote significant resources to figuring out what causes a nation&apos;s real GDP to rise. They focus on the roles of capital goods, technology, and a few related factors. ANALYZE INFORMATION How is high GDP per capita linked to quality of life? Capital Deepening Physical capital, the equipment used to produce goods and services, makes an important contribution to the output of an economy. With more physical capital, each worker can be more productive, producing more output per hour of work. Economists use the term labor productivityto describe the amount of output produced per worker. Even if the size of the labor force does not change, more physical capital will lead to more output&ndash;in other words, to economic growth. This process of increasing the amount of capital per worker, called capital deepening, is one of the most important sources of growth in modern economies. (See Figure 7.12.) This process is also known as capital formation. Human capital, the productive knowledge and skills acquired by a worker through education and experience, also contributes to output. Firms, and employees themselves, can deepen human REAL GDP PER CAPITA REAL GDP The growth in a nation’s economy is

Along with increasing output per worker, capital deepening tends to increase job opportunities and workers&apos; earnings. To understand why this happens, consider the effect of greater worker productivity on the demand for workers. If workers can produce more output per hour, they become more valuable to their employers. As a result, employers will demand more workers. This increase in demand will increase the equilibrium wage rate in the labor market. Therefore, with a labor force of a given size, capital deepening will increase output and workers&apos; wages. How, then, does an economy increase its stock of capital per worker? It does so through saving and investment. DRAW CONCLUSIONS Why does capital deepening work with human capital? Saving and Investment To see how saving and investment are related, consider an economy with no government sector and no foreign trade. In this simplified economy, consumers and business firms purchase all output. In other words, output can be used for consumption (by consumers) or investment (by firms). Income that is not used for consumption is called saving. Since output can only be consumed or invested, whatever is not consumed must be invested. Therefore, in this simplified economy, saving is equal to investment. The proportion of disposable income that is saved is called the savings rate. To see this another way, look at an individual&apos;s decision, as shown in Figure 7.13. Shawna had an after-tax income of $30,000 last year, but she spent only $25,000. That left her with $5,000 available for saving. She used some of her leftover income to purchase shares in a mutual fund, giving her ownership of some stocks and bonds. She put the rest of the money into a savings account at her bank. Through her mutual-fund firm, her bank, and other intermediaries, Shawna&apos;s $5,000 was made available to businesses. The firms used the money to invest in new plants and equipment. So, when Shawna chose not to spend her entire income, the amount that she saved became available for business investment. If we consider the economy as a whole, the process works the same way. If total saving rises, more investment funds become available to businesses. This accumulation of savings made available for investment is called capital formation. Those firms will use most of these funds for capital investment. That is, they will expand the stock of capital in the business sector. CAPITAL DEEPENING Capital deepening occurs when businesses buy machines and equipment that lead to greater worker productivity. Increased productivity leads to increased demand for workers, higher wages, and economic growth. + INCREASED LABOR PRODUCTIVITY Better-trained workers use improved equipment to produce more. INCREASED for the company and economic INCREASED INCREASED OUTPUT More productive workers lead to increased output growth. LABOR DEMAND Economic growth leads employers to demand more workers. WAGES The increased demand for more workers will increase the equilibrium wage rate. PHYSICAL CAPITAL BENEFITS COMPANIES BENEFITS WORKERS Equipment used to produce goods and services improves. HUMAN CAPITAL Workers gain skills to operate improved equipment. OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH >> Figure 7.12 Analyze Charts How does capital deepening benefit workers?

understand why most nations promote saving. In
the long run, more saving will lead to higher output
and income for the population, raising GDP and the
standard of living.
The United States has a low savings rate. To
obtain the investment funds they need, businesses
and the government borrow from other countries
with higher savings rates. IDENTIFY CAUSE AND EFFECT How is saving
linked to capital deepening? The Effects of Population,
Government, and Trade
Now we will consider a slightly more realistic
economy that has population growth, a government
sector, and foreign trade. First, think about the effect
of population growth on capital accumulation.
Population Growth Population growth does not
necessarily preclude economic growth. However,
if the population grows while the supply of capital
remains constant, the amount of capital per worker will shrink. This process, the opposite of capital
deepening, leads to lower living standards. In fact,
some relatively poor countries, such as Bangladesh,
have large labor forces but small capital stocks.
The result is that output per worker— and
earnings per worker—are relatively low. Conversely,
a nation with low population growth and expanding
capital stock will enjoy significant capital deepening.
Government Government can affect capital
formation in several ways. If government raises tax
rates to pay for additional services or to finance a
war, households will have less money. People will
reduce saving, thus reducing the money available
to businesses for investment. In these cases, the
government is taxing households in order to pay for
its own consumption spending. The net effect is
reduced investment. On the other hand, a different result occurs if
government invests the extra tax revenues in public
goods such as roads and telecommunications.
These public goods are called infrastructure, the
underlying necessities of modern life. Spending on
infrastructure increases investment. To see why,
consider what share of income the average household
saves.
Suppose that, on average, households save
10 percent of their income. In this case, for every
extra dollar in tax revenue the government collects,7.3 Economic Growth 313 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="380"> <text><![CDATA[ household saving (and investment) drops by 10 cents. However, government investment in infrastructure rises by $1. The net result is an increase in total investment of 90 cents. This kind of spending, then, is capital deepening, since the government is taxing its citizens to provide investment goods. Foreign Trade Foreign trade can result in a trade deficit, a situation in which the value of goods a country imports is higher than the value of goods it exports. Running a trade deficit may not seem like a wise practice, but if the imports consist of investment goods, the practice can foster capital deepening. Investment goods are the structures and equipment purchased by businesses. Capital deepening can offset the negative effects of a trade deficit by helping to generate economic growth, helping a country pay back the money it borrowed in the first place. In the mid-1800s, for example, the United States financed the building of the transcontinental railroad in part by borrowing funds from investors in other countries. The borrowing created a trade deficit, but it also helped create a much higher rate of economic growth than would have occurred otherwise. The railroad promoted new industries and opened up vast areas to farming, leading to a huge increase in the nation&apos;s farm output. >> Port dredging is an example of investment in infrastructure. Dredging deepens the port, which allows larger ships and increased trade. Of course, not all trade deficits promote capital deepening. In this regard, trade deficits are similar to government taxation. Whether they encourage capital deepening and economic growth depends on how the funds are used. If they are used for short- term consumption, the economy will not grow any faster, and it will not have any additional GDP to pay back the debts. If the funds are used for longterm investment, however, they will foster capital deepening. The resulting economic growth will bring the country prosperity in the future. Trade can support economic growth by helping countries focus on producing what they are best at producing (having either an absolute advantage or a comparative advantage) and trading it, while buying other goods that they cannot produce as easily. Trade that results in importing goods can provide an economy with resources it might not otherwise have, which helps the economy grow. Exporting goods can enlarge a market for those goods, creating a stronger economy that is built on access to bigger markets. For example, a nation with access to the sea might develop a strong fishing industry and export some of the catch to a landlocked country. The landlocked country might have abundant forests from which to export wood products. Such trade can grow the economies of both countries. Trade is essential for economies to specialize in what they are most efficient at producing. EXPRESS IDEAS CLEARLY Do higher taxes increase or reduce investment? Technological Progress Another key source of economic growth is technological progress. This term usually brings to mind new inventions or new ways of performing a task, but in economics, it has a more precise definition. Technological progress is an increase in efficiency gained by producing more output without using more inputs. Technological progress occurs in many ways. It can result from new scientific knowledge&ndash;for example, nanotechnology, making computer chips smaller and smaller&ndash;that has practical uses. It can be a new invention that allows workers to produce goods more efficiently. It could even be a new method for organizing production. All of these advances raise a nation&apos;s productivity. Increased productivity means producing more output with the same amounts of land, labor, and capital. With technological progress, a society enjoys higher real GDP per capita, which leads to a higher standard of living. 314 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Bounce to Activate Gallery Measuring Technological Progress In most modern economies, the amount of physical and human capital changes all the time. So do the quantity and quality of labor and the technology used to produce goods and services. These interconnected variables work together to produce economic growth. How, then, can we isolate and measure the effects of technological progress? Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize–winning economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a method for doing so. Solow&apos;s method was to determine how much growth in output comes from increases in capital and how much comes from increases in labor. He concluded that any remaining growth in output must then come from technological progress. Between 1929 and 1982, the average annual growth rate of real GDP was 2.92 percent. Using Solow&apos;s method, economist Edward Denison has estimated that technological progress boosted the real GDP 1.02 percent per year, on average. Denison determined that increases in capital and labor were responsible for 0.56 percent and 1.34 percent of the average annual growth, respectively (2.92 &ndash; 0.56 &ndash;1.34 = 1.02). Technological progress, then, was the second most important factor in promoting economic growth in that period. Causes of Technological Progress Since technological progress is such an important source of economic growth, economists have looked for its causes. They have found a variety of factors that influence technological progress. Scientific research Scientific research can generate new or improved production techniques, improve physical capital, and result in better goods and services. Innovation When new products and ideas are successfully brought to the market, output goes up, boosting GDP and business profits. Yet innovation often requires costly research. Companies willing to carry out that research need assurance that they will profit from the products they develop. The government issues patents to provide that assurance. A patent is a set of exclusive rights to produce and sell a product for a particular period of time. It is given to people who can show that they have discovered or invented a new product or process. Currently, patents last 20 years. A patent helps a company recover the cost of research by earning profits before its competitors can copy its new products. Government aids innovation in several other ways as well. Through organizations such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, the United States government sponsors basic research. This term describes theoretical research that is often expensive and might not bring a new product to market in a timely way. 7.3 Economic Growth 315 ]]></text>

Types of Unemployment
It is important to understand the causes of unemployment in order
to foster a better job market. General economic conditions, lengthy
job searches, and seasonal production schedules are some of the
factors that cause unemployment.
Economists look at four categories of unemployment: frictional,
seasonal, structural, and cyclical. Sometimes, factors outside
the economy can cause unemployment. The various kinds of
unemployment have different effects on the economy as well as on
the people who are unemployed. Frictional Unemployment Unemployment always exists, even
in a booming economy. Frictional unemployment occurs when
people take time to find a job. For example, people might change
jobs, be laid off from their current jobs, or need some time to find
the right position after they finish their schooling. They might
be returning to the workforce after a long period of time. In the
following examples, all three people are considered frictionally
unemployed.

Liz left her sales job two years ago to care for an aging parent. Now she is trying to return to the workforce. None of these three people found work immediately. While they look for work, they are frictionally unemployed. In the large, diverse U.S. economy, economists expect to find many people in this category. Unemployment insurance, which provides income to laid-off workers seeking new jobs, may contribute slightly to frictional unemployment. A worker receiving unemployment insurance faces somewhat less financial pressure to find a new job immediately. Structural Unemployment The structure of the American economy has changed over time. Two centuries ago, people needed basic farming skills to survive. As the country developed an industrial economy, farm workers moved to urban areas to work in factories. Today, service industries are rapidly replacing manufacturing industries, and information services are expanding at breakneck speed. >> Maria Contreras-Sweet was nominated to head the U.S. Small Business Administration in January 2014. According to the SBA, small businesses create two out of three new jobs. All these shifts lead to upheavals in the labor market. When the structure of the economy changes, the skills that workers need to succeed also change. Workers who lack the necessary skills lose their jobs. Structural unemployment occurs when workers&apos; skills do not match those needed for the jobs that are now available. There are five major causes of structural unemployment. The development of new technology New inventions and ideas often push out older ways of doing things. For example, downloading music has hurt the sales of compact discs. Firms making CDs have let workers go, and those workers must find jobs in another field. The discovery of new resources New resources replace old resources. The discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania in 1859 severely hurt the whale-oil industry. Whaling-ship crews lost their jobs and did not have the skills needed for the petroleum industry. Changes in consumer demand Consumers often stop buying one product in favor of another. Many people now favor athletic shoes over more traditional kinds of shoes. As a result, traditional shoemaking jobs have declined. Globalization The mobility of capital and labor has fueled a shift from local to international markets. Countries have become more open to foreign trade and investment in a trend called globalization. As a result, companies often relocate jobs or entire facilities to other countries where costs are lower. Celia, for example, spent many years working on an automobile assembly line in Michigan. When her company moved much of its auto assembly work to Mexico, where labor is less expensive, Celia lost her job. Unfortunately, there were no local jobs that matched Celia&apos;s skills. Lack of education People who drop out of school or fail to acquire the minimum skills needed for today&apos;s job market may find themselves unemployed, employed part time, or stuck in low-wage jobs. For example, Martin barely managed to graduate from high school. When he was hired as a clerk by a local clothing store, he had trouble using the computerized checkout register. The store manager fired Martin after just two months because he lacked the skills needed for the job. Policymakers in the 1990s and 2000s recognized that computer technology, globalization, and other structural changes threatened the futures of many workers. As a result, they developed job-training programs to help workers gain new skills, especially computer skills. 318 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Some companies offer their own training programs. In this way, they can teach trainees the specialized skills they need to become valued employees. Seasonal Unemployment Gregory is a brick mason for a small construction company in the northeastern United States. Every winter Gregory&apos;s employer lays off all seven of his employees when cold weather forces an end to outdoor work. In the spring, he hires them back again for the new construction season. Gregory and his co-workers are examples of people who experience seasonal unemployment. In general, seasonal unemployment occurs when industries slow or shut down for a season or make seasonal shifts in their production schedules. Seasonal unemployment can also occur as a result of harvest schedules or vacations. When this school year ends, you or your friends may need some time to find the perfect summer job. Until you do so, economists will count you as seasonally unemployed. As with frictional unemployment, economists expect to see seasonal unemployment throughout the year. Government policymakers do not take steps to prevent this kind of unemployment, because it is a normal part of a healthy economy. Still, the lives of seasonally unemployed workers can be extremely difficult. Migrant agricultural workers, for example, travel throughout the country to pick fruits and vegetables as various crops come into season. They know that their work will likely end when winter arrives. Migrant workers can also have periods of unemployment even during harvest season, depending on the weather. Heat, cold, rain, and drought can ruin harvest schedules by causing fruits and vegetables to ripen sooner or later than expected. Instead of moving smoothly from crop to crop, migrant workers might lose work time waiting for a crop to be ready for picking. Cyclical Unemployment Unemployment that rises during economic downturns and falls when the economy improves is called cyclical unemployment. During recessions, or downturns in the business cycle, the demand for goods and services drops. The resulting slowdown in production causes the demand for labor to drop as well, and companies begin to lay off employees. Many of these laid-off employees will be rehired when the recession ends and the business cycle >> A counselor at a summer day camp is an example of a seasonal worker. Bounce to Activate Chart resumes an upward trend. Although economists expect cyclical unemployment, it can severely strain the economy and greatly distress the unemployed. The most damaging example of cyclical unemployment in the twentieth century was the Great Depression. During the Great Depression, one out of every four workers was unemployed. Many remained jobless for years. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed, and Congress passed, the Social Security Act. In addition to providing monthly payments for retirees and people who could not support themselves, the Social Security Act established a program of unemployment insurance. Today, unemployment insurance still provides weekly payments to workers who have lost their jobs. The payments usually provide about half of a worker&apos;s lost wages each week for a limited amount of time. Circumstances Outside the Economy Sometimes events outside the economy can cause unemployment. The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon cost the country an estimated 1.5 to 2 million jobs. Many of the lost jobs were in the travel and tourism industries. 7.4 Unemployment 319 ]]></text>

In Manhattan, the area around the World Trade Center site was hit especially hard, and New York City lost some 150,000 jobs. Natural disasters also affect employment. In October 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast region. The powerful storm caused widespread destruction, and thousands of people lost their jobs. Many families were relocated to other areas while their communities were being rebuilt. Months later, unemployment among people affected by Hurricane Katrina was still higher than the national average. COMPARE ANd CONTRAST How is cyclical unemployment different from seasonal unemployment? The Unemployment Rate The amount of unemployment in the nation is an important clue to the health of the economy. For this reason, the government keeps careful track of how many people are unemployed, and why. To measure employment, the United States Bureau of the Census conducts a monthly household survey for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). For this survey, called the Current Population Survey, interviewers poll 60,000 families about employment during that month. This sample is designed to represent the entire population of the United States. The BLS, a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor, analyzes the data from the survey to identify how many people are employed and how many are unemployed. Using these numbers, the BLS computes the unemployment rate, or the percentage of the nation&apos;s labor force that is unemployed. Interpreting the Unemployment Rate The labor force is composed of civilians age 16 and older who have a job or are actively looking for a job. To determine the unemployment rate, BLS officials add up the number of employed and unemployed people. That figure equals the total labor force. Then they divide the number of unemployed people by the total labor force and multiply by 100. The result is the percentage of people who are unemployed. For example, in September 2007, the Current Population Survey showed that 146.3 million people were employed, and 7.2 million were unemployed. The total labor force, therefore, was 153.5 million. Dividing 7.2 million by 153.5 million and then multiplying the result by 100 yields an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent for that month. CALCULATING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
To calculate the
unemployment
rate, use the
following formula:
Number of people
unemployed
divided by number
of people in the
civilian labor force
multiplied by 100 FOR EXAMPLE
If the number of people
unemployed = 7 million and the number of people
in the civilian labor force = 151.4 million THEN 7 ÷ 151.4 = .046
.046 × 100 = 4.6 THEREFORE the unemployment rate is 4.6% >> Analyze Charts How would the unemployment rate change if the number of

Analyze Charts What was the unemployment rate with discouraged and involuntary part-timers in 2010? Bounce to Activate Chart Adjusting the Unemployment Rate When you see the unemployment rate for a particular month, it has usually been “seasonally adjusted.” This means that the rate has been increased or decreased to take into account the level of seasonal unemployment. Taking this step allows economists to more accurately compare unemployment rates from month to month. This comparison helps them better detect changing economic conditions. The unemployment rate is only an average for the nation. It does not reflect regional differences. Some areas, such as the coal-mining region of Appalachia in the southeastern United States, have long had a higher-than-average unemployment rate. The BLS and individual state agencies therefore establish unemployment rates for states and other geographic areas. These rates help pinpoint trouble areas on which policymakers can focus attention. EXPLAIN Why do states keep track of their own unemployment rates? The Goal of Full Employment Zero unemployment is not an achievable goal in a market economy, even under the best of circumstances. Economists generally agree that in an economy that is working properly, an unemployment rate of around 4 to 6 percent is normal. Such an economy would still experience frictional, seasonal, and structural unemployment. In other words, full employment is the level of employment reached when no cyclical unemployment exists. Underemployment Full employment means that nearly everyone who wants a job has a job. But are all those people satisfied with their jobs? Not necessarily. Some people working at low-skill, low- wage jobs may be highly skilled or educated in a field with few opportunities. They are underemployed, that is, working at a job for which they are overqualified, or working part time when they desire full-time work. For example, Jim, a philosophy major, earned a graduate degree in philosophy. When he left school, Jim found that although the economy was booming, he could not find jobs in which he could apply his knowledge of philosophy. Jim found a part-time job that did not pay well and did not challenge his mind. He was underemployed. Underemployment also describes the situation of people who want a permanent, full-time job but have not been able to find one. Many part-time workers and seasonal workers fit into this category. 7.4 Unemployment 321 ]]></text>

These discouraged workers have stopped searching for employment and may rely on other family members or savings to support them. Although they are without jobs, discouraged workers do not appear in the unemployment rate determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because they are not actively looking for work. If underemployed and discouraged workers were included, the unemployment rate would be much higher than reported. Some estimates are that the 2009 unemployment rate would have been above 17 percent. United States economic policy encourages full employment in various ways. Monetary and fiscal policies, for example, aim to promote strong but sustainable growth, which in turn will keep employment rates high. Full employment benefits individuals and society as a whole because more people can provide for themselves and their families and pay taxes. Full employment also benefits the economy as a whole because employed people are better able to save and invest money, leading to capital formation. The federal government also spends money to improve infrastructure such as highways. Such projects promote fuller employment and increasing economic output due to the improved infrastructure. These projects come at the cost, however, of higher eventual taxes to cover the projects&apos; costs.

How Rising Prices Affect You
As you will see, you cannot escape rising prices. Economists
believe that the money supply, changes in demand, and increased
production costs all contribute to a rise in prices throughout the
economy. Higher prices can affect your life.
Inflation Josephine and Jack Barrow have owned the same house
for 50 years. Recently, they had a real estate agent estimate their
home’s present market value. The Barrows were astounded. The
house that they had bought for $12,000 was now worth nearly
$150,000—a rise in value of more than 1,100 percent.
How could the value of a house, or anything else, increase
so much? The main reason is inflation. Inflation is a general
increase in prices across an economy. Over the years, prices
generally go up. Since World War II, real estate prices have risen
greatly.
The Barrows were pleased their house was worth so much.
Then they realized that inflation had raised the prices of all
houses, just as it had also raised wages and the prices of most
other goods and services. As a result, they could not buy a similar

    <page pageNumber="390"> <text><![CDATA[ Purchasing Power Another way to look at the Barrows&apos; situation is that inflation had shrunk the value, or purchasing power, of the Barrows&apos; money. Purchasing power is the ability to purchase goods and services. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money declines. That is why $12,000 buys much less now than it did 50 years ago. GENERATE EXPLANATIONS Why does inflation cause purchasing power to decrease over time? Price Indexes Housing costs are just one element that economists consider when they interpret economic data that reflect inflation and other price changes. The economy has thousands of goods and services, with millions of individual prices. How do economists compare the changes in all these prices in order to measure inflation? The answer is that they do not compare individual prices; instead, they compare price levels. Price level is the cost of goods and services in the entire economy at a given point in time. To help them calculate price level, economists use a price index. A price index is a measurement that shows how the average price of a standard group of goods changes over time. A price index produces an average that economists compare to earlier averages to see how much prices have changed over time. How Price Indexes Are Used Price indexes help consumers and business owners make economic decisions. For example, after Marina read in the newspaper that prices for consumer goods had been  rising, she increased the amount of money she was saving for a new car. She wanted to be sure that when the time came to buy the car, she had saved enough money to pay for it. The government also uses indexes in making policy decisions. A member of Congress, for example, might push for an increase in the minimum wage if she thinks inflation has reduced purchasing power. The Consumer Price Index Although there are several price indexes, the best-known index focuses on consumers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is computed each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CPI is determined by measuring the price of a standard group of goods meant to represent the “market basket” of a typical urban consumer. This market basket is a representative collection of goods and services. By looking at the CPI, consumers, businesses, and the government can compare the cost of a group of goods this month with what the same or a similar group cost months or even years ago. As you can see from Figure 7.14, the CPI market basket is divided into eight categories of goods and services. These categories, and a few examples of the many items in each, are shown. About every ten years, the items in the market basket are updated to account for shifting consumer buying habits. The BLS determines how the market basket should change by conducting a Consumer Expenditure Survey. The BLS conducted one such survey from 2000 to 2001, collecting spending information from 10,000 families.

Calculating the Inflation Rate Economists also find it useful to calculate the inflation rate&ndash;the percentage rate of change in price level over time. The inflation rate can be calculated between any two points in time, typically between two years. An inflation rate calculated from one year to the next gives a snapshot of current economic conditions. An inflation rate calculated from many years ago to today shows how inflation has changed over a longer period of time. To calculate the inflation rate, use the following formula: CPI for Year A – CPI for Year B/ CPI for Year B x 100. Since the CPI is the most familiar price index, we will focus on it. How does the BLS determine the CPI and use it to calculate the inflation rate? Calculating CPI To determine the CPI, the BLS establishes a base period to which it can compare current prices. Currently, the base period is 1982–1984. The cost of the market basket for that period is assigned the index number 100. Every month, BLS representatives update the cost of the same market basket of goods and services by rechecking all the prices. Each updated cost is compared with the base-period cost to determine the index for that month. As costs rise, the index rises. The BLS determines the CPI for a given year using the following formula: CPI = updated cost ÷ base-period cost x 100 For example, suppose the market basket cost $200 during the base period and costs $360 today. The CPI for today would be: $360 ÷ $200 x 100 = 180 In this example, the CPI rose from 100 in the base period to 180 today. Types of Inflation Inflation rates in the United States have changed greatly over time as you can see in Figure 7.15 . When the inflation rate stays low&ndash;between 1 and 3 percent&ndash;it does not typically cause problems for the economy. In this environment, businesses and governments can make plans. When the inflation rate exceeds 5 percent, however, the inflation rate itself becomes unstable and unpredictable. This makes planning very difficult. Sometimes the inflation rate spikes sharply, as in 1974 and 1980. These sharp increases in the inflation rate were due in part to increases in prices in world food and oil markets. In order to study long-term trends in the inflation rate, analysts need to set aside temporary spikes in food and fuel prices. To do this, economists have developed the concept of a core inflation rate. The core inflation rate is the rate of inflation excluding the effects of food and energy prices. By far the worst kind of inflation is hyperinflation, or inflation that is out of control. During periods of hyperinflation, inflation rates can go as high as 100 or even 500 percent per month, and money loses much of its value. This level of inflation is rare, but when it occurs it often leads to a total economic collapse. CONSTRUCT How is the Consumer Price Index calculated? 7.5 Inflation and Deflation 325 ]]></text>

Price levels can rise steeply when demand for goods and services exceeds the supply available at current prices, such as during wartime. They can also rise steeply when productivity is restricted&ndash;for example, when a long drought leads to poor harvests. Nobody can explain every instance of rising price levels. However, economists have several theories about the causes of inflation. These include the growth of the money supply, changes in aggregate demand, and changes in aggregate supply. Economists look at all of these elements when they try to understand the inflation process. Growth of the Money Supply The quantity theory of inflation states that too much money in the economy causes inflation. Therefore, the money supply should be carefully monitored to keep it in line with the nation&apos;s productivity as measured by real GDP. Economists at the University of Chicago developed a popular version of this theory in the 1950s and 1960s. They maintained that the money supply could be used to control price levels in the long term. The key to stable prices, they said, was to increase the supply of money at the same rate as the economy was growing.  Changes in Aggregate Demand Aggregate demand is the amount of goods and services in the economy that will be purchased at all possible price levels. Inflation can occur when demand for goods and services exceeds existing supplies. During wartime, for example, the government&apos;s need for military supplies puts pressure on producers. The heavy demand for new equipment, supplies, and services increases the value of those items, pushing prices up. Wages also rise as the demand for labor increases along with the demand for goods. Changes in Aggregate Supply Finally, inflation occurs when producers raise prices in order to meet increased costs. Higher prices for raw materials can cause costs to increase. Wage increases, however, are most often the biggest reason, because wages are the largest single production cost for most companies. One cause of wage increases is low unemployment. Employers must then offer higher wages to attract and retain workers. Wage increases can also occur as a result of collective bargaining. For example, Jen is a union laborer at Am-Gro Fertilizer. The union she belongs to recently won a large wage increase from the company. The increased cost for labor led Am-Gro to raise its prices in order to maintain its profits. Such a situation can lead to a spiral of ever-higher prices, because one increase in costs leads to an increase in prices, which leads to another increase Inflation Rate, 1970–2010 Percent change per year 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 14 8 10 12 6 4 0 2 Year SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics High fuel and food prices >> Figure 7.15 Analyze Graphs According to the graph, when was the last time inflation topped 4 percent?Bounce to Activate Gallery  326 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges]]></text>

The effect of a wage-price spiral on Am-Gro Fertilizer
is shown in Figure 7.16 IDENTIFY Which three factors affect inflation? Interpreting Effects of
Inflation
High inflation is a major economic problem,
especially when inflation rates change greatly from
year to year. Buyers and sellers find planning for
the future difficult, if not impossible. The effects of
inflation can be seen mainly in purchasing power,
income, and interest rates.
Effects on Purchasing Power You have seen, in
the example of Jack and Josephine Barrow’s house,
how inflation can erode purchasing power. In an
inflationary economy, a dollar will not buy the same
number of goods that it did in years past. When
there is no inflation, $1 buys the same amount of
goods it did in the previous year. If the inflation
rate is 10 percent this year, however, $1 will buy the equivalent of only $.90 worth of goods today. In this
case, the purchasing power of a dollar has fallen.
Effects on Income Inflation sometimes, but not
always, erodes income. If wage increases match the
inflation rate, a worker’s real income stays the same.
People who do not receive their income as wages,
such as doctors, lawyers, and businesspeople, can
often increase their incomes by raising the prices
they charge in order to keep up with inflation.
Not all people are so fortunate. If workers’ wages
do not increase as much as inflation does, they are in
a worse economic position than before. Since prices
are higher, their income has less purchasing power.
People living on a fixed income are hit especially
hard by inflation. A fixed income is income that does
not increase even when prices go up. The Barrows, for
example, who are retired, are hurt by high inflation.
The portion of their income from Social Security
payments rises with the price level, because the
government raises Social Security benefits to keep up
with inflation. Much of their income, however, comes
from a pension fund that pays them a fixed amount of
money each month. Inflation steadily eats away at the
real value of that pension check.
Effects on Interest Rates People receive a given
amount of interest on money in their savings accounts, 7.5 Inflation and Deflation 327]]></text>

For example, Sonia had her savings in an account that paid 7 percent interest. At the same time, the annual inflation rate was 5 percent. As a result, the purchasing power of Sonia&apos;s savings increased that year by only 2 percent, because 5 percent of her interest was needed to keep up with inflation. When a bank&apos;s interest rate matches the inflation rate, savers break even. The amount they gain from interest is taken away by inflation. However, if the inflation rate is higher than the bank&apos;s interest rate, savers lose money. Effects on National Economies In the 1970s and early 1980s, the United States experienced high inflation. Prices rose at times more than 10% per year. People with savings and fixed incomes saw the value of their money fall. As a result, inflation discouraged savings and investment, and economic growth suffered. More recently, countries such as Brazil and Zimbabwe have experienced hyperinflation, with prices sometimes doubling every day. When inflation is this high, people rush to spend any money they earn. Saving, borrowing, and investment are impossible, and an economic crisis causes widespread suffering. ANALYZE DATA What is the true return on a savings account for the year if the interest rate is 6 percent and the inflation rate is 2 percent? Recent Trends in the Rate of Inflation Americans under age 30 have experienced fairly low inflation rates for most of their lifetimes. In the late 1990s, unemployment levels were low. Deflation As the economy entered a period of recession and slow growth in the 2000s, inflation fell to less than 2 percent. Rising unemployment and falling capital investment removed two factors that might have led to inflation due to increases in aggregate supply. Prices at times seemed to be falling. Some experts even predicted a period of deflation, or a sustained drop in the price level. However, the economy recovered. Although inflation remained relatively low through 2007, by mid-2008, soaring energy costs had pushed the inflation rate past 4 percent. The 2008 Recession By the end of 2008, the economy was in crisis. A severe recession led to a slowdown in economic activity. Global demand for oil dropped, and the price of gasoline plunged by 30 percent in one month. The CPI was 3 percent lower than it had been just three months earlier. The record decline in retail prices and sales put added pressure on the federal government to solve the economic crisis and avoid a renewed threat of deflation.

Living in Poverty
Statistically, you are at greater risk for living in poverty if you
come from a single-parent home, live in the inner city, or do not
have at least a high school education. Other factors, including the
way that income is distributed, also affect the poverty rate.
As you have read, the United States Bureau of the Census
conducts extensive surveys to gather data about the American
people. Its economists then analyze the data and organize them to
reveal important characteristics.
One key feature they look at is how many families and
households live in poverty. The Census Bureau defines a familyas
a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or
adoption who live in the same housing unit. A householdis all
people who live in the same housing unit, regardless of how they
are related.
What is Poverty? According to the government, a poor family
is one whose total income is less than the amount required to
satisfy the family’s minimum needs. The Office of Management
and Budget determines the income level, known as the poverty >> Private groups also work to alleviate

The poverty threshold is the income level below which income is insufficient to support a family or household. The poverty threshold, or poverty line, varies with the size of the family. For example, in 2013, the poverty threshold for a single parent under age 65 with one child was $15,510. For a family of four with two children, it was $23,550. If a family&apos;s total income is below the poverty threshold, everyone in the family is counted as poor. The Census Bureau determines how many people and families are living below the poverty line. Measuring Poverty Trends in the national poverty rate are shown in Figure 7.17. The poverty rate is the percentage of people who live in households with income below the official poverty threshold. Poverty rates for various groups are shown in Figure 7.18. We can use poverty rates to discover whom the government considers to be poor and what factors seem to contribute to poverty. Poverty rates differ sharply by groups, according to several different indicators: Race and ethnic origin The poverty rate among African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans is more than twice the rate for white Americans.

Bounce to Activate Chart Type of family Families with a single mother have a poverty rate more than four times greater than that of two-parent families. Age The percentage of children living in poverty is significantly larger than that for any other age group. Adults between the ages of 18 and 64 are the next largest group. Residence Inner-city residents have double the poverty rate of those who live outside the inner city. People who live in rural areas also have a higher poverty rate, especially in regions where job prospects are limited. dEfINE What is the poverty rate? What Causes Poverty? Put simply, a family is poor when the adults in the family fail to earn enough income to provide for its members&apos; basic needs. This failure to earn adequate income is often the result of unemployment. Millions of Americans are unemployed for a variety of reasons. While they are out of a job, their families might well fall below the poverty threshold. Many other poor adults are not even considered a part of the labor force. Some suffer from chronic health problems or disabilities that prevent them from working. Others are discouraged workers who are no longer looking for work. Many poor adults do have jobs, however. In fact, more than half of poor households have someone who works at least part time, and one in five have a full- time, year-round worker. For these “working poor,” the problem is usually low wages or a limited work schedule, rather than the lack of a job. For example, Ray makes $9 an hour as a full-time clerk in a clothing store. While he is at work, his wife stays at home with their two young children. Although Ray works 40 hours per week, and his salary is well above the minimum wage, his annual earnings amount to just $18,720, which is below the poverty threshold for a family of four. Economists agree that poverty and lack of income go hand in hand, but they have different ideas about the causes of poverty. Here are some of the most important explanations for why some people are poor. Changes in Family Structure Single-parent families are more likely to live in poverty than two- parent families. That is especially the case when the lone parent is a single mother. The divorce rate has risen significantly since the 1960s, as has the number of children born to unmarried parents. 330 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Which groups have the lowest? These demographic shifts tend to result in more single-parent families and more children living in poverty. Where People Live In most American cities, racial minorities are concentrated in the inner cities, far from the higher-wage jobs in suburban areas. Many of these inner-city residents do not own cars, and mass-transit systems are often not an efficient means of commuting from the inner city to the suburbs. As a result, people who live in the inner city earn less than people living outside the inner city. Similar obstacles exist for many people living in rural areas, where there is little business or industry. Unequal Treatment White workers generally earn higher salaries than minority workers, and men generally earn more than women. Much of this income inequality can be explained by differences in hours worked, education, and work experience. Part of the inequality, however, results from racial and gender discrimination. Even when all the workers in a group are equally productive, whites are often paid more than African Americans, and men are often paid more than women. Economists agree, however, that discrimination based on race or gender has been diminishing. Low-Wage Service Jobs In the past, less- educated people could earn good wages working in manufacturing jobs. Globalization, the decline in manufacturing, and the rise of the service economy have led to a decline in the number of higher- paying manufacturing jobs. More workers with less education now work in low-skill service jobs, where wages are often not as high as they are for factory jobs. Lack of Education The median income in 2011 for full-time workers between the ages of 25 and 34 who did not complete high school was $22,860, which was below the poverty threshold for a family of four in that year. Those with high school diplomas or the equivalent earned median incomes of nearly $30,000 a year for full-time work, while college graduates earned a median of nearly $45,000 a year, or more than twice as much as those who did not complete high school. IDENTIFY CAUSE AND EFFECT Why are racial and gender discrimination a cause of poverty?

Income Distribution Income distribution figures do not reflect the effects of taxes or non- cash government aid such as housing subsidies, healthcare, or food stamps. The food stamp program helps low-income people buy food. Benefits are provided on an electronic card that is accepted at most food stores. Look at Figure 7.19. To compute the numbers in the table, economists take four steps. First, they rank the nation&apos;s households according to income. Then, they divide the list into fifths, or quintiles, with equal numbers of households in each fifth. The lowest fifth, which appears at the top of the list, includes the poorest 20 percent of households. The highest fifth, shown at the bottom of the list, includes the richest 20 percent of households. The first column in Figure 7.19 shows this division into quintiles. Next, they compute each group&apos;s average income by adding up the incomes of all the households in the group and then dividing by the number of households. Finally, they compute each group&apos;s share, or percentage, of total income by dividing the group&apos;s total income by the total income of all the groups. The second column shows each group&apos;s share. The third column shows the cumulative total. (For example, the lowest two fifths of households earned 12 percent of the total income.) Compare the share of the poorest fifth with that of the richest fifth. If you divide richest by poorest, you will see that the richest fifth receives nearly 15 times the income of the poorest fifth. Now look at Figure 7.20. It shows that the numbers for shares of total income, when they are plotted on a graph, form a curve. This graph, called the Lorenz Curve, illustrates the distribution of income in the economy. Let&apos;s see what this Lorenz Curve tells you. First, read the label on each axis. Then look at the straight line running diagonally across the graph. This reference line represents complete equality. Under conditions of complete equality, each quintile would receive one fifth of total income. That means the lowest 20 percent of households would receive 20 percent of total income, as shown by the point (lowest, 20). Similarly, the lowest 40 percent (the first two quintiles) would receive 40 percent of total income, as shown by the point (second, 40), and so on. In 2010, the distribution of income was not equal, as the Lorenz Curve indicates. For example, the point (lowest, 3.3) shows that the lowest 20 percent, or one fifth, of households received just 3.3 percent of the nation&apos;s total income. Percent of Total Income by Quintile, 2010 3.3% 8.5% 14.6% 23.4% 50.2% Lowest fifth Second fifth Third fifth Fourth fifth Highest fifth 3.3% 11.8% 26.4% 49.8% 100% QUINTILE PERCENT OF INCOME FOR QUINTILE CUMULATIVE PERCENT OF INCOME FOR THIS AND LOWER QUINTILES NOTE: Because of rounding, totals may be greater than or less than 100 percent.

Cumulative Distribution of Income(percentage) The point (second, 11.8) shows that the lowest 40 percent, or two fifths, of households received only 11.8 percent of the income. The area on the graph between the line of equality and the Lorenz Curve represents the amount of inequality in income distribution. The larger the area between the curves, the greater the income inequality. Differences in Income As you can see from Figure 7.19 and Figure 7.20, the wealthiest fifth of American households earned more income (50.2 percent) than the bottom four fifths combined. Why are there such differences in income among Americans? Here are some factors. Differences in skills and education Some people are more highly skilled than others, so they earn higher wages. Labor skills are determined by education, training, and a worker&apos;s natural ability. Inheritances Some people inherit large sums of money and earn income by investing it. Others inherit businesses that produce income from profits. Field of work Wages are determined by the demand for labor. Labor demand is a “derived demand” because it is set by demand for what people produce. People who produce goods with a low market value usually earn lower wages. James Webb, a former United States senator from Virginia, commented on the growing income gap: America&apos;s top tier has grown infinitely richer and more removed over the past 25 years . . . . The top 1 percent now takes in an astounding 16 percent of national income, up from 8 percent in 1980. &ndash;James Webb, the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 15, 2006 In fact, in the last two decades, the distribution of income has become less equal. Since 1977, the share of income earned by the lowest three fifths has decreased by 12 percent, while the share earned by the top 1 percent has more than doubled. IDENTIFY Name one program the government uses to help alleviate income inequality. The Economic Goal of Equity The government spends billions of dollars on programs designed to reduce poverty. This money is spent mainly on cash assistance, education, medical benefits, and non-cash benefits such as food stamps and subsidized housing. The stated goal of these programs is not to provide equal distribution of wealth. Rather, it is to ensure a basic standard of 7.6 Poverty and Income Distribution 333 ]]></text>

Low taxes and business-friendly policies encourage businesses to locate in Texas. living for all and to provide the poor an opportunity to improve their condition. Critics of antipoverty programs argue that the programs themselves harm some of the people they are intended to help by encouraging people to remain dependent on government programs. Some analysts say the programs raised unrealistic hopes of eradicating poverty. The costs of the programs have increased as the programs have expanded. Some critics do not object to the antipoverty programs as much as they object to the increase in the size of the government required to administer the programs. The criticisms have led to new policies. These include the Earned Income Tax Credit, the establishment of enterprise zones, job training and other employment assistance, housing assistance, and welfare reform. The Earned Income Tax Credit One of the government&apos;s most successful antipoverty programs is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is a refundable tax credit that low-income families with children receive when they file their federal income tax return. Eligibility is based on the taxpayer&apos;s earned income and the number of qualifying children. In 2010, for example, a married couple with an earned income of $40,363 and two children would receive a maximum credit of $5,036. Established in 1975 to offset the impact of the Social Security payroll tax on low-income families, the EITC has been expanded over the years. A report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that in 2005, the EITC lifted more than four million people above the official poverty line and was “the nation&apos;s most effective antipoverty program for working families.” Enterprise Zones Areas where companies can locate and be free of certain state, local, and federal taxes and restrictions on business operations called enterprise zones, became popular in the 1980s. Zones benefit businesses by lowering their costs. They help local people by making it easier for them to find work. By providing jobs, these zones can help revitalize areas such as inner cities. Job Training In recent decades, federal and state governments have designed job-training programs to help workers who lack the skills to earn an adequate income. In addition, the federal government has made a minimum wage mandatory since 1938. The minimum wage ensures that workers&apos; hourly pay will not fall below a certain point. 334 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

In one approach, the government makes payments to landlords who then lower the rent they would otherwise charge. In another program, poor people receive vouchers that cover part of the rent they pay. The third approach is government-owned housing, which charges low rental fees. Welfare to Workfare Poor people often cannot afford basic needs such as food and medical care. The United States has long had a welfare system that provides for those basic needs, especially for children and the elderly. That system underwent major reform when President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. This welfare-reform plan responded to criticisms that welfare encouraged poor people to remain unemployed in order to keep receiving aid. It replaced the traditional antipoverty program for poor families (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC) with a new program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). TANF eliminated cash assistance for poor families. Instead, the federal government provides block grants, or lump sums of money, to the states. The states are now responsible for designing and implementing programs to move most poor adults from welfare dependence to employment. TANF also set a five- year limit on receipt of benefits. The plan calls for a shift from welfare to workfare&ndash;a program requiring work in exchange for temporary assistance from the government. It was hoped that this reform would reduce poverty by providing poor Americans with labor skills and access to a steady, adequate income. Addressing Poverty The federal government has several major types of redistribution programs to help the poor, elderly, and disadvantaged. State and federal governments provide cash transfers, or direct payments of money to poor, disabled, or retired people. The following examples are cash transfer programs: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Launched in 1996, TANF does not provide direct federal welfare payments to the poor. Instead, federal money goes to the states, which design and run their own welfare programs. States must adhere to federal rules that create work incentives and establish a lifetime limit for benefits. TANF aims to move people from depending on welfare to joining the workforce. Social Security The Social Security program was created in 1935, during the Great Depression. At the time, many elderly people lost their life savings and had no income. The program collects payroll taxes from current workers and then redistributes 7.6 Poverty and Income Distribution 335 ]]></text>

Those who receive Social Security include retired people, people unable to work because of a disability, and, in some cases, the widowed spouses or orphaned children of such individuals. Unemployment insurance Unemployment insurance is funded by taxes paid by employers. Compensation checks provide money to workers who have lost their jobs. Recipients must offer proof that they have made efforts to get work. As with TANF, states set the rules for this program. The program is supposed to supply only temporary help. As a result, most states pay benefits to workers for only 26 weeks. In periods of high unemployment, however, the government may decide to pay the benefits longer. Workers&apos; compensationThis program is an insurance program for workers injured or disabled on the job. It is mandated, or required, by state law. Most employers pay workers&apos; compensation insurance to cover future claims by employees. In-Kind Benefits The government also provides poor people with in-kind benefits, goods and services provided for free or at greatly reduced prices. One example is the food stamp program. People who qualify receive a debit card or smart card that they can use to help meet food expenses. Another type of in-kind benefit is subsidized housing. Poor people are allowed to rent housing for less than the regular rent. The government pays the difference to the landlord. Legal aid is legal advice given at no charge. This in-kind benefit covers contracts and other business matters. Poor people charged with a crime may be represented in court by public defenders, who are paid with tax dollars. The right of an accused person to have legal counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Another social service that the U.S. government provides is medical benefits, meaning health insurance for children and people who are elderly, disabled, or poor. Medicare covers Americans over age 65 and disabled people. Medicaid covers some poor people who are unemployed or not covered by their employer&apos;s insurance plans. Administered under the Social Security program, Medicare and Medicaid are enormously expensive programs. A program called the Children&apos;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health insurance for children who are uninsured. CHIP is funded by both state and federal governments. States write the rules for the program within federal guidelines. The program covers more than 6.5 million children. 336 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Education Programs Federal, state, and local governments all provide educational opportunities to those who need aid. The federal government funds programs from preschool to college. State and local programs aid students with learning disabilities. Education programs add to the nation&apos;s human capital and labor productivity. As explained earlier, improved education and technology can make an entire economy more productive. RECALL Who pays for the Children&apos;s Health Insurance Program? Charitable Donations In addition to providing direct assistance to the needy, federal and state governments also encourage private action to help people in need. Federal tax law allows both individuals and corporations to take tax deductions for charitable donations. This policy provides an economic incentive to give money and property to relief organizations, as well as to other nonprofit groups such as churches, hospitals, colleges, libraries, or museums. In 2012, American individuals and organizations gave more than $316 billion in tax-deductible charitable contributions. There are opportunity costs associated with donating to charity. Money given away cannot be spent or invested in other productive ways. In addition, governments lose vital tax revenues by allowing deductions for charitable giving. Still, governments encourage it. As one tax expert noted: It&apos;s always better to give than receive. The glory of charitable donations is that you give and receive at the same time. &ndash;Jeff Schnepper, “Give and Grow Rich With Charitable Deductions” The government may also provide grants and other assistance to organizations that provide social services. A grant is a financial award given by a government agency to a private individual or group in order to carry out a specific task. Many people believe that private groups do a more effective job of helping people than the government can. In 2001, President George W. Bush announced a new initiative that allowed religious organizations to receive federal funding support for programs to alleviate poverty. The President believed that these groups provided a special compassion that made their programs particularly successful. Bush established an Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships to help religious groups work more effectively with the federal government. 7.6 Poverty and Income Distribution 337 ]]></text>

 LESSON SUMMARIES Use these lesson summaries, and the longer versions available online, to review the key ideas for each lesson in this topic. Lesson 1: Gross Domestic Product LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of all final goods and services produced in a country or region in a given year. It measures an economy&apos;s size. When GDP is corrected for inflation, it is called real GDP. GDP ignores nonmarket and informal activities, externalities, and quality of life. GDP depends on the interaction of aggregate supply&ndash;supply throughout the economy&ndash; and aggregate demand&ndash;demand for all products in the economy. It rises and falls with these variables. Lesson 2: Business Cycles LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.12 A business cycle is a period of economic expansion, or growth, followed by a period of contraction. Stages of the cycle depend on the rate of business investment, interest rates, consumer expectations, and the effects of external shocks. It is difficult to forecast business cycles accurately. The United States has passed through a series of contractions&ndash;such as the Great Depression or the recession of 2008&ndash;and expansions&ndash;such as the 1990s boom or the expansion after 2009. Lesson 3: Economic Growth SS.912.E.2.5, SS.912.E.3.2 GDP is a measure of economic growth, but because it also reflects population growth, economists use GDP per capita (or per person) as a measure of prosperity. Increased capital investment per worker boosts productivity and prosperity. Savings and investment help build the capital stock. Government action and trade can also affect prosperity. Technological progress can improve the productivity of capital and thereby boost prosperity. Lesson 4: Unemployment SS.912.E.1.10, SS.912.E.1.12 Unemployment can result from people being between jobs, not having skills needed by employers, seasonal lulls in an industry, or contractions in a business cycle. Full employment is the level reached at the peak of the business cycle, though some workers may still be unemployed due to job changes, lack of skill, or the season. Even with full employment, there may be people who are underemployed or who have given up looking for work. Lesson 5: Inflation and Deflation SS.912.E.2.7, SS.912.E.3.1 Inflation is a general increase in prices across an economy. Price indexes measure inflation. Inflation may be caused by increases in the money supply, decreases in aggregate supply, or increases in aggregate demand. Inflation reduces people&apos;s purchasing power if their incomes do not keep pace. Inflation also reduces the real value of interest rates. Deflation is a sustained drop in price levels. The recession of 2008 caused fears of deflation, which can discourage economic growth. Lesson 6: Poverty and Income Distribution SS.912.E.1.9 The government defines poverty as an income too low to satisfy minimum needs. The poverty rate is the percentage of households below that income. Poverty tends to occur in families with a single income, in areas with few good jobs, or as a result of discrimination or a lack of education. Incomes vary greatly among households in the United States. To relieve poverty, the government and charitable contributions fund antipoverty programs.

number of unemployed people by the labor
force and multiply by 100.
To calculate the inflation rate, subtract the
base year price index from the current index.
Then divide the result by the base year index
and multiply that result by 100.
The government establishes a poverty
threshold, an income level below which
total income is insufficient to support
a family or household.
