Specialization leads to efficiency in the use of capital, land, and labor. It is better for people to learn one task or a few tasks very well than to learn a little about many tasks. Because they concentrate on one or a few tasks, they can do their work more efficiently, saving resources by avoiding waste. For this reason, the top performers in most fields are specialists who have worked hard to sharpen their particular skills. Specialization also benefits businesses. Focusing on a limited number of related products or services allows them to use their limited capital and labor more efficiently. Buying and Selling People in primitive cultures had to make everything they needed from materials they gathered from nature. Even in more recent times, some people strive for self-sufficiency. However, because most of us in the modern world specialize in producing just a few goods or services, we need a mechanism that allows us to sell what we have produced and to buy what we want. Figure 2.3 illustrates this concept. In a modern market-based economy, people typically earn income by specializing in particular jobs. They then use this income to buy the products that they want to consume. IdentIfy MaIn Ideas Why do markets exist? Elements of a Free Market Economy In a free market economy, answers to the three basic economic questions are made by voluntary exchange in markets. The choices made by individuals determine what gets made, how it is made, and how much people can consume of the goods and services produced. Individuals and businesses make their own decisions about what to buy or sell. Market economies are also called capitalist economies because the capital that entrepreneurs invest in businesses is a vital part of the system. In a free market system, individuals and privately owned businesses own the factors of production, make what they want, and buy what they want. In other words, individuals answer the three basic >> Figure 2.3 This farmer specializes in raising one crop, using income from its sale to purchase equipment and other goods. Test Conclusions What evidence can you see that the farmer earns income from the specialized production of one crop? questions of what to produce, how to produce it, and who consumes what is produced. The United States has a free market economic system. This system is commonly referred to as the United States free enterprise system. In general, free enterprise, free market, and capitalism are all synonyms for the economic system of the United States. Households and Firms The participants in a free market economy are households and firms. A household is a person or group of people living in a single residence. Households own the factors of production&ndash;land, labor, and capital. They are also consumers of goods and services. A business, or firm, is an organization that uses resources to produce a product or service, which it then sells. Firms transform inputs, or factors of production, into outputs, or goods and services. We can represent the exchanges that take place in a free market economy in a diagram called a circular flow model. Look at Figure 2.4. The diagram shows how households and firms exchange money, resources, and products in the marketplace. The inner ring of the diagram represents the flow of resources and products. Note that both households and firms are resource owners in this model. The outer ring represents the flow of money. Factor and Product Markets As you can see from the lower half of the model, firms purchase factors of production from households. This arena of exchange is called the factor market. An example of this is when firms purchase or rent land. They hire workers, paying them wages or salaries for their labor. They also borrow money from households to purchase capital, paying households interest or profits in return. Now look at the top half of the circular flow model. The arena in which households buy the goods and services that firms produce is the product market. So, when you buy food at a supermarket, you are taking part in the product market physical flow. If you follow the rings of the diagram, you will see that in the product market, households purchase the products made by firms with the money they receive from firms in the factor market. The monetary and physical flows through the factor and product markets are truly circular. express Ideas Clearly What is the role of firms in the free market economy? >> Figure 2.4 The circular flow model shows the interaction between households and fi rms in a free market.

    <page pageNumber="25"> <text><![CDATA[ LAFS.1112.WHST.1.1 Write arguments focused on discipline-specific content. Introduce precise, knowledgeable claim(s), establish the significance of the claim(s), distinguish the claim(s) from alternate or opposing claims, and create an organization that logically sequences the claim(s), counterclaims, reasons, and evidence. Develop claim(s) and counterclaims fairly and thoroughly, supplying the most relevant data and evidence for each while pointing out the strengths and limitations of both claim(s) and counterclaims in a discipline-appropriate form that anticipates the audiences knowledge level, concerns, values, and possible biases. Use words, phrases, and clauses as well as varied syntax to link the major sections of the text, create cohesion, and clarify the relationships between claim(s) and reasons, between reasons and evidence, and between claim(s) and counterclaims. Establish and maintain a formal style and objective tone while attending to the norms and conventions of the discipline in which they are writing. Provide a concluding statement or section that follows from or supports the argument presented. LAFS.1112.WHST.1.2 Write informative/explanatory texts, including the narration of historical events, scientific procedures/ experiments, or technical processes. Introduce a topic and organize complex ideas, concepts, and information so that each new element builds on that which precedes it to create a unified whole; include formatting (e.g., headings), graphics (e.g., figures, tables), and multimedia when useful to aiding comprehension. Develop the topic thoroughly by selecting the most significant and relevant facts, extended definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples appropriate to the audiences knowledge of the topic. Use varied transitions and sentence structures to link the major sections of the text, create cohesion, and clarify the relationships among complex ideas and concepts. Use precise language, domain-specific vocabulary and techniques such as metaphor, simile, and analogy to manage the complexity of the topic; convey a knowledgeable stance in a style that responds to the discipline and context as well as to the expertise of likely readers. Provide a concluding statement or section that follows from and supports the information or explanation provided (e.g., articulating implications or the significance of the topic). LAFS.1112.WHST.2.4 Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience. LAFS.1112.WHST.2.5 Develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach, focusing on addressing what is most significant for a specific purpose and audience. LAFS.1112.WHST.2.6 Use technology, including the Internet, to produce, publish, and update individual or shared writing products in response to ongoing feedback, including new arguments or information. LAFS.1112.WHST.3.7 Conduct short as well as more sustained research projects to answer a question (including a self-generated question) or solve a problem; narrow or broaden the inquiry when appropriate; synthesize multiple sources on the subject, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation. LAFS.1112.WHST.3.8 Gather relevant information from multiple authoritative print and digital sources, using advanced searches effectively; assess the strengths and limitations of each source in terms of the specific task, purpose, and audience; integrate information into the text selectively to maintain the flow of ideas, avoiding plagiarism and overreliance on any one source and following a standard format for citation. LAFS.1112.WHST.3.9 Draw evidence from informational texts to support analysis, reflection, and research. LAFS.1112.WHST.4.10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for reflection and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes, and audiences. MAFS.K12.MP.1.1 Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="26"> <text><![CDATA[ objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, Does this make sense? They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify correspondences between different approaches. MAFS.K12.MP.3.1 Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and if there is a flaw in an argument explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies. Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments. MAFS.K12.MP.5.1 Use appropriate tools strategically. Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a mathematical problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system, a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data. Mathematically proficient students at various grade levels are able to identify relevant external mathematical resources, such as digital content located on a website, and use them to pose or solve problems. They are able to use technological tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts. MAFS.K12.MP.6.1 Attend to precision. Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure, and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.

SS.912.FL.1.1 Discuss that people choose jobs or careers for which they are qualified based on non-income factors, such as job satisfaction, independence, risk, family, or location. SS.912.FL.1.2 Explain that people vary in their willingness to obtain more education or training because these decisions involve incurring immediate costs to obtain possible future benefits. Describe how discounting the future benefits of education and training may lead some people to pass up potentially high rates of return that more education and training may offer. SS.912.FL.1.3 Evaluate ways people can make more informed education, job, or career decisions by evaluating the benefits and costs of different choices. SS.912.FL.1.4 Analyze the reasons why the wage or salary paid to workers in jobs is usually determined by the labor market and that businesses are generally willing to pay more productive workers higher wages or salaries than less productive workers. SS.912.FL.1.5 Discuss reasons why changes in economic conditions or the labor market can cause changes in a workers income or may cause unemployment. SS.912.FL.1.6 Explain that taxes are paid to federal, state, and local governments to fund government goods and services and transfer payments from government to individuals and that the major types of taxes are income taxes, payroll (Social Security) taxes, property taxes, and sales taxes. SS.912.FL.1.7 Discuss how peoples sources of income, amount of income, as well as the amount and type of spending affect the types and amounts of taxes paid. SS.912.FL.2.1 Compare consumer decisions as they are influenced by the price of a good or service, the price of alternatives, and the consumers income as well as his or her preferences. SS.912.FL.2.2 Analyze situations in which when people consume goods and services, their consumption can have positive and negative effects on others. SS.912.FL.2.3 Discuss that when buying a good, consumers may consider various aspects of the product including the products features.

    <page pageNumber="29"> <text><![CDATA[ SS.912.FL.3.2 Examine the ideas that inflation reduces the value of money, including savings, that the real interest rate expresses the rate of return on savings, taking into account the effect of inflation and that the real interest rate is calculated as the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. SS.912.FL.3.3 Compare the difference between the nominal interest rate which tells savers how the dollar value of their savings or investments will grow, and the real interest rate which tells savers how the purchasing power of their savings or investments will grow. SS.912.FL.3.4 Describe ways that money received (or paid) in the future can be compared to money held today by discounting the future value based on the rate of interest. SS.912.FL.3.5 Explain ways that government agencies supervise and regulate financial institutions to help protect the safety, soundness, and legal compliance of the nations banking and financial system. SS.912.FL.3.6 Describe government policies that create incentives and disincentives for people to save. SS.912.FL.3.7 Explain how employer benefit programs create incentives and disincentives to save and how an employees decision to save can depend on how the alternatives are presented by the employer. SS.912.FL.4.1 Discuss ways that consumers can compare the cost of credit by using the annual percentage rate (APR), initial fees charged, and fees charged for late payment or missed payments. SS.912.FL.4.2 Discuss that banks and financial institutions sometimes compete by offering credit at low introductory rates, which increase after a set period of time or when the borrower misses a payment or makes a late payment. SS.912.FL.4.3 Explain that loans can be unsecured or secured with collateral, that collateral is a piece of property that can be sold by the lender to recover all or part of a loan if the borrower fails to repay. Explain why secured loans are viewed as having less risk and why lenders charge a lower interest rate than they charge for unsecured loans. SS.912.FL.4.4 Describe why people often make a cash payment to the seller of a good&ndash;called a down payment&ndash;in order to reduce the amount they need to borrow. Describe why lenders may consider loans made with a down payment to have less risk because the down payment gives the borrower some equity or ownership right away and why these loans may carry a lower interest rate. SS.912.FL.4.5 Explain that lenders make credit decisions based in part on consumer payment history. Credit bureaus record borrowers credit and payment histories and provide that information to lenders in credit reports. SS.912.FL.4.6 Discuss that lenders can pay to receive a borrowers credit score from a credit bureau and that a credit score is a number based on information in a credit report and assesses a persons credit risk. SS.912.FL.4.7 Describe that, in addition to assessing a persons credit risk, credit reports and scores may be requested and used by employers in hiring decisions, landlords in deciding whether to rent apartments, and insurance companies in charging premiums. SS.912.FL.4.8 Examine the fact that failure to repay a loan has significant consequences for borrowers such as negative entries on their credit report, repossession of property (collateral), garnishment of wages, and the inability to obtain loans in the future. SS.912.FL.4.9 Explain that consumers who have difficulty repaying debt can seek assistance through credit counseling services and by negotiating directly with creditors. SS.912.FL.4.10 Analyze the fact that, in extreme cases, bankruptcy may be an option for consumers who are unable to repay debt, and although bankruptcy provides some benefits, filing for bankruptcy also entails considerable costs, including having notice of the bankruptcy appear on a consumers credit report for up to 10 years. SS.912.FL.4.11 Explain that people often apply for a mortgage to purchase a home and identify a mortgage is a type of loan that is secured by real estate property as collateral. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="30"> <text><![CDATA[ SS.912.FL.4.12 Discuss that consumers who use credit should be aware of laws that are in place to protect them and that these include requirements to provide full disclosure of credit terms such as APR and fees, as well as protection against discrimination and abusive marketing or collection practices. SS.912.FL.4.13 Explain that consumers are entitled to a free copy of their credit report annually so that they can verify that no errors were made that might increase their cost of credit. SS.912.FL.5.1 Compare the ways that federal, state, and local tax rates vary on different types of investments. Describe the taxes effect on the after-tax rate of return of an investment. SS.912.FL.5.2 Explain how the expenses of buying, selling, and holding financial assets decrease the rate of return from an investment. SS.912.FL.5.3 Discuss that buyers and sellers in financial markets determine prices of financial assets and therefore influence the rates of return on those assets. SS.912.FL.5.4 Explain that an investment with greater risk than another investment will commonly have a lower market price, and therefore a higher rate of return, than the other investment. SS.912.FL.5.5 Explain that shorter-term investments will likely have lower rates of return than longer-term investments. SS.912.FL.5.6 Describe how diversifying investments in different types of financial assets can lower investment risk. SS.912.FL.5.7 Describe how financial markets adjust to new financial news and that prices in those markets reflect what is known about those financial assets. SS.912.FL.5.8 Discuss ways that the prices of financial assets are affected by interest rates and explain that the prices of financial assets are also affected by changes in domestic and international economic conditions, monetary policy, and fiscal policy. SS.912.FL.5.9 Examine why investors should be aware of tendencies that people have that may result in poor choices, which may include avoiding selling assets at a loss because they weigh losses more than they weigh gains and investing in financial assets with which they are familiar, such as their own employers stock or domestic rather than international stocks. SS.912.FL.5.10 Explain that people vary in their willingness to take risks because the willingness to take risks depends on factors such as personality, income, and family situation. SS.912.FL.5.11 Describe why an economic role for a government may exist if individuals do not have complete information about the nature of alternative investments or access to competitive financial markets. SS.912.FL.5.12 Compare the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve, and other government agencies that regulate financial markets. SS.912.FL.6.1 Describe how individuals vary with respect to their willingness to accept risk and why most people are willing to pay a small cost now if it means they can avoid a possible larger loss later. SS.912.FL.6.2 Analyze how judgment regarding risky events is subject to errors because people tend to overestimate the probability of infrequent events, often because theyve heard of or seen a recent example. SS.912.FL.6.3 Describe why people choose different amounts of insurance coverage based on their willingness to accept risk, as well as their occupation, lifestyle, age, financial profile, and the price of insurance. SS.912.FL.6.4 Explain that people may be required by governments or by certain types of contracts (e.g., home mortgages) to purchase some types of insurance. SS.912.FL.6.5 Describe how an insurance contract can increase the probability or size of a potential loss because having the insurance results in the person taking more risks, and that policy features such as deductibles and copayments are cost-sharing features that encourage the policyholder to take steps to reduce the potential size of a loss (claim). ]]></text>

SS.912.FL.6.7 Compare the purposes of various types of insurance, including that health insurance provides for funds to pay for health care in the event of illness and may also pay for the cost of preventative care; disability insurance is income insurance that provides funds to replace income lost while an individual is ill or injured and unable to work; property and casualty insurance pays for damage or loss to the insureds property; life insurance benefits are paid to the insureds beneficiaries in the event of the policyholders death. SS.912.FL.6.8 Discuss the fact that, in addition to privately purchased insurance, some government benefit programs provide a social safety net to protect individuals from economic hardship created by unexpected events. SS.912.FL.6.9 Explain that loss of assets, wealth, and future opportunities can occur if an individuals personal information is obtained by others through identity theft and then used fraudulently, and that by managing their personal information and choosing the environment in which it is revealed, individuals can accept, reduce, and insure against the risk of loss due to identity theft. SS.912.FL.6.10 Compare federal and state regulations that provide some remedies and assistance for victims of identity theft. ]]></text>

In many ways, it is unlike any other state in the country. The following pages provide snapshots of Florida&apos;s geography, people, government, economy, and place in the world. So read on, and discover why there is so much to celebrate about Florida! SS.912.G.3.3, LAFS.1112.WHST.1.2, LAFS.1112.WHST.3.7, LAFS.1112.WHST.3.8 Florida&apos;s geography is unique. Most of the state occupies a peninsula separating the Florida has seven regions. As you read, locate each region on the map. PANHANDLEChoctawhatchee River PerdidoR. 1 6 7 Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Its coastline is one of the longest of the fifty states, and includes the most southerly point in the continental United States. Much of Florida is less than 100 feet above sea level, although northern and central areas are higher in elevation. While the northwestern part of the state is informally known as the “Panhandle,” Florida&apos;s Regions 2 1 3 4 5 The Tallahassee Hills stretch from the Apalachicola River east to the Suwannee River. Like the Western Highlands, this is an important agricultural area. The Western Highlands extend from the Perdido River on the Alabama border to the Choctawhatchee River. Like other areas in the Panhandle, this hilly terrain produces field crops. The Marianna Lowlands lie between the Choctawhatchee River in the west and the Apalachicola River in the east. The Central Highlands extend east from the Suwannee River to Saint Johns River. The highlands also extend south through central Florida, where most of Florida&apos;s citrus production is located. The Kissimmee Lowlands The Kissimmee River basin supplies Lake Okeechobee with water and provides xxxii land for citrus groves and cattle ranches. Its canals, dikes, and pumping stations comprise a complex system of water resource use and management overseen by the South Florida Water Management District. The district works to protect and restore the river basin ecosystem, manage the basin&apos;s plant life and land, improve water quality, and regulate the water supply. The Lake Okeechobee- Everglades Basin South of Lake Okeechobee the land is devoted to agricultural production of crops such as sugarcane. Further south is the Everglades National Park, protecting the fragile ecosystem of the Everglades&ndash;a shallow, slow-moving river that provides a habitat for hundreds of species of animals. The Coastal Lowlands occupy about three-quarters of Florida&apos;s land area, as you can see from the darker shading on the map. Offshore barrier bars and islands protect lagoons and bays and help create Florida&apos;s famous beaches. ]]></text>

Florida can be divided into two climate regions, north and south of a line running from Bradenton to Vero Beach (see map on previous page).

Tall doors and windows catch the breezes to cool the house. Walls are covered in stucco, a kind of cement that protects walls from rain and heat. Mediterranean Revival Style Florida&apos;s climate has influenced the style and materials of its buildings. As new residents arrived in the state during the land boom of the 1920s, a Mediterranean Revival style spread. With its low-pitched, red tiled roofs and stucco walls, this style was perfectly suited to Florida&apos;s history and climate, and helped give the state its distinct look. Power and Fury Hurricane Andrew caused widespread damage in South Florida in August, 1992. Like much of the southeast and east coast of the United States, Florida lies in the path of hurricanes that form in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, or off the west coast of Africa. As these storms drift toward Florida, their terrifying energy is intensified by the ocean&apos;s warm waters and especially by the Gulf Stream. The hurricane season lasts from June to November, although September is the month when many storms strike the state. xxxv ]]></text>

Its northern soils provided fertile ground for the cash crops grown on plantations that depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans. The state&apos;s climate helped launch a series of land booms as vacationers and new residents swelled its population and fueled its economy. For centuries, its strategic location has conferred on Florida a range of military roles, from protecting Spain&apos;s treasure fleet to training U.S. troops during the conflicts of the twentieth century. Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine Florida&apos;s strategic military importance was established by the Spanish fort of St. Augustine, founded in 1565, partly to protect the route of the Spanish treasure fleet, whose loot-laden ships sailed back to Spain on the fast-moving currents of the Gulf Stream. xxxvi ]]></text>

It was here that their enslaved African American workforce grew cash crops, including cotton. By 1850 there were about 1,000 cotton plantations in Florida. Rocket Launch at Cape Canaveral Florida Aeronautics During the conflicts and Cold War tensions of the twentieth century, Florida&apos;s geographical location increased its strategic importance. The state&apos;s flat terrain and wide beaches encouraged early flight testing and air force training, an aeronautic tradition that led to the establishment of Cape Canaveral for missile testing and space exploration. ASSESSMENT Key Ideas 1. Why is Florida a strategic location for the military? Critical Thinking 2. Infer The South Florida Water Management District is a government agency that oversees water resources in southern Florida. The state has four other water management districts. Use this information and the map on these pages to answer the following question: Why do you think Florida&apos;s government has stepped in to provide policies and programs for managing Florida&apos;s water resources? Use geographic terms such as resources and ecosystem in your answer. Writing 3. Explain Perspectives Gather information from a variety of print and online sources, including maps, on the use of renewable and non-renewable resources in Florida. Analyze each source for its strengths and weaknesses&ndash; for example, is it based on fact or opinion? Then write a few paragraphs describing the different perspectives you found, making sure to avoid plagiarizing and citing your sources in standard format. Do not rely too heavily on any one source and be sure to use geographic terms in your answer. xxxvii ]]></text>

In the context of economics, a Quest is a search to understand the causes and meaning of major economic events, debates, or decisions. In this program, each Topic begins with one of three types of Quests: Document-Based Question Quests, Civic Action Project Quests, and Civic Discussion Quests. The introduction to each Topic&apos;s Quest can be found at the start of each Topic in this text. Economics is the study of how people seek to satisfy their needs and wants by making choices among scarce resources. Although it may seem that economics has very little to do with you, in fact, you make economic decisions every day. Every economic decision involves trade-offs. That&apos;s why it is important to understand basic economic concepts. As you complete these Quests, you will gain greater insight into the various economic forces and events that have shaped both the history of Florida and the United States. As you conduct research for some of these Quests, be sure to consult the Florida Memory website of the State Library and Archives of Florida (https://www.floridamemory.com/), as well as other digital and print resources. The materials you need to complete each Quest can be found online in the Quest folders, including complete instructions, sources, rubrics, and lots of other resources.

It not only declared the independence of a colony from its mother country&ndash; thereby setting a precedent for other oppressed peoples around the world to do the same&ndash;it also established the first government of, by, and for the people. The ideas expressed in the Declaration of Independence also had a profound effect on later developments in American history. You will notice the relationship of the ideas behind the Declaration of Independence to the American Revolution, the writing of the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, and the movements to end slavery and to give women the right to vote. You&apos;ll see how the United States became a nation of immigrants, with its rich diversity of people, and the ways this development relates to the ideas of the Declaration of Independence. Read the first three paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence. Then recite words from the Declaration of Independence quoted at left. Consider their meaning and then answer these questions. ASSESSMENT 1. Identify Central Idea What do the words of the preamble (left) say to you about the American ideal of individual liberty? 2. Contrast How does the idea of government based on a “social contract” differ from the idea behind a monarchy? A dictatorship? 3. Apply Information Identify two ways that your federal, state, or local government protect the rights to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. lxiv ]]></text>

As part of this celebration, your teacher may ask you to participate in planning and holding a Constitution Day assembly. Organize As a class, create the basic plan for your assembly. Discuss the following: 1. When and where should the assembly take place? 2. How long should it take? Should you plan on a short program taking a single class period, or a longer program? 3. Who should be involved? Will other classes or other grades take part? Will you invite outsiders, such as parents or people from the community? 4. What activities might be included? Plan After your discussion, divide the class into committees to complete jobs such as getting permission from the school administration, preparing a program, inviting any guests, advertising the plan beforehand, and blogging about it afterward. Give thought to the types of activities that might be included in the assembly. You might invite a guest speaker from your community. You might run an essay contest among students and have the winners read their essays during the assembly. Some students might prepare a video presentation about the Bill of Rights. Others might write and perform a skit about what the Declaration of Independence or U.S. Constitution mean to them. You might start your assembly by asking everyone to rise to say the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag.

That&apos;s what economics is all about. Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and governments make choices when faced with a limited supply of resources. Scarcity forces us all to make choices by making us decide which options are most important to us. In this section, you will examine the problem of scarcity as it relates to such varied resources as water and the ingredients needed to make a ham and cheese sandwich. Unlimited Wants, Limited Resources The study of economics begins with the fact that people cannot have everything they need and want. A need is something essential for survival, such as food or medical care. A want is something that we desire but that is not necessary for survival, such as video games or stylish haircuts. People satisfy their needs and wants with goods and services. Goods are physical objects that someone produces, such as food, clothing, or video games. Services are actions or activities that one person performs for another. Medical care and haircuts are services.

    <page pageNumber="71"> <text><![CDATA[ 1.1 Scarcity 5 People&apos;s needs and wants are unlimited. When one want is satisfied, others arise. After eating lunch, you might want to go to a movie or buy some clothes. Goods and services, however, are limited. No one can have an endless supply of anything. Sooner or later, a limit is always reached. The fact that limited amounts of goods and services are available to meet unlimited wants is called scarcity. At many different levels, scarcity forces people to make choices. For example, you have to decide how to spend your time. If you decide to study for a test, you cannot go to the mall or do volunteer work at the same time. A store must choose between hiring ten new workers or paying for more advertising to attract new customers. A city council debates whether to use its money to fix an aging school building or to hire more firefighters. Economics is the study of how people seek to satisfy their needs and wants by making choices. Because people act individually, in groups (such as businesses), and through governments, economists study all three of these arenas for economic decisionmaking. Scarcity Does Not Mean Shortage Scarcity is not the same thing as shortage. A shortage occurs when consumers want more of a good or service than producers are willing to make available at a particular price. Fans of a top singer will find a shortage of $25 seats at one of his or her concerts. Performers and promoters are simply not willing to provide many seats at that price. Shortages may be temporary or long-term. Unlike shortages, scarcity always exists and is a problem faced by all societies. There simply are not enough goods and services to supply all of society&apos;s needs and wants. Each of that singer&apos;s fans not only wants to go to the concert, but also wants to download the singer&apos;s songs, have dinner, buy a new top, and purchase other goods and services. Scarcity is unavoidable, because the resources that go into making goods and services are themselves scarce. Synt hesi ze What is the main focus of economics? Entrepreneurs Use Factors of Production How are scarce resources turned into goods and services? Entrepreneurs play a key role.

By producing new goods and services and hiring workers, they fuel economic growth. The first task facing an entrepreneur is to assemble factors of production, or the resources used to make all goods and services. The three main factors of production are land, labor, and capital. Jean-Baptiste Say, an eighteenth-century French economist, thought the risk-taking entrepreneur so important that he should be considered a fourth factor of production. Land Economists use the term land to refer to all natural resources used to produce goods and services. Natural resources are any materials found in nature that people use to make things or to provide services. These resources include fertile land for farming, as well as resources found in or on the land such as oil, iron, coal, water, and forests. Labor The second factor of production is labor. Labor is the effort people devote to tasks for which they are paid. Labor includes the medical care provided by a doctor, the classroom instruction provided by a teacher, and the tightening of a bolt by an assembly-line worker. Labor is also an artist&apos;s creation of a painting or a technician&apos;s repair of a television. Capital The term capital refers to any human-made resource that is used to produce other goods and services. Economists divide capital into two types&ndash; physical capital and human capital. Human-made objects used to create other goods and services are physical capital. (Sometimes economists use the term capital goods for physical capital.) The buildings that house a computer manufacturing company are physical capital, as are all the equipment and tools needed to make those computers. In addition to producing physical capital, people can also invest in themselves. The knowledge and skills a worker gains through education and experience are human capital. Computer designers go to college to study engineering, electronics, and computers. They increase their human capital, making it possible for them to design and build faster and more powerful computers. Auto mechanics also increase their human capital through schooling and experience. This knowledge gives them the skills to diagnose and fix an engine that is not running properly. An economy requires both physical and human capital to produce goods and services. Doctors need both stethoscopes and schooling to provide healthcare. Carpenters require both tools and the skills they gain through training and practice. 1 2A new business starts with an idea.

The Effectiveness of Capital Capital is a key factor of production because people and companies can use it to save a great deal of time and money. Physical capital such as machines and tools helps workers produce goods and services more easily and at less cost. Businesses that buy and use these kinds of business property usually become more productive. Human capital such as technical knowledge has the same result. The more skills a worker gains, the more productive he or she becomes. Many businesses provide training for their employees for this reason. To understand the benefit of purchasing capital, consider the following example: A family washes dishes by hand after every meal&ndash;breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That is a total of 21 meals per week. It takes 30 minutes per meal for two family members working together to scrape, stack, wash, rinse, dry, and put away the dishes. As a result, the family spends 21 hours a week cleaning dishes&ndash;time that could have been spent on other, more productive activities. Now, suppose that the family saves up and spends $400 on a piece of physical capital&ndash;a dishwasher. Using the dishwasher, it takes only one family member a mere 15 minutes after each meal to stack the dishwasher and another family member just 15 minutes at the end of the day to empty the machine and put the dishes away, for a total of 1 hour a day. A chore that used to require 21 hours a week to complete now takes only 7 hours a week. This example shows the typical benefits of using capital: 1. Extra time The family saves 14 hours a week. This is time that can be used for other activities. 2. More knowledge By learning how to use the dishwasher, family members learn more about using household appliances in general. They can apply that knowledge to using washing machines, dryers, and other appliances. In the same way that a family benefits from investing in a piece of physical capital like a dishwasher, a business usually benefits from purchasing and using business property. When a business invests in technology, such as new machinery, it often benefits by saving time. In addition, workers are likely to gain new types of knowledge. 3. More productivity With extra time and more knowledge, family members can use their resources and labor to do other chores, to learn other skills, or simply to enjoy themselves. Every member of the family benefits. IdENTIfy A plow used to prepare soil for planting is an example of what factor of production? All Resources Are Scarce All goods and services are scarce because the resources used to produce them are scarce. Consider a fresh sandwich made at a restaurant. The sandwich roll might have started as wheat in a field in Kansas and then been milled into flour and later baked in an oven. The cheese might have been made from milk from Wisconsin cows, and the chicken may have been raised in Arkansas. The lettuce and tomatoes may have been grown in California. All of these ingredients may have been shipped 1.1 Scarcity 7 ]]></text>

The land, labor, and capital resources used to produce these ingredients are all scarce. to a restaurant in Seattle, where a chef made the sandwich and served it to a hungry customer. All the factors of production used to produce the sandwich are scarce. First, the amount of land and water available for growing crops and raising livestock is limited. Second, the labor available to grow the crops, mill the flour, bake the rolls, and serve the food is limited by the size, time, age, and energy of the population. Finally, the amount of physical capital available to produce the sandwich, such as farm machines or baking equipment, is also limited. The same principles apply to a pair of blue jeans, a tablet computer, or a space shuttle. No matter what good or service we look at, the supplies of land, labor, and capital used to produce it are scarce. We also notice another fact about those resources &ndash;each one has many alternative uses. The land could have been used to grow yams or parsnips. The farm workers could have chosen to work in the timber industry. Physical capital could have been put to other uses as well. Individuals, businesses, and governments have to choose which alternative they most want. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS Why are goods and services scarce? ASSESSMENT 1.

Every time we choose to do something, we give up the opportunity to do something else. As you will see, even such a simple decision as how late to sleep in the morning involves weighing costs and benefits. Economists point out that all individuals, businesses, and large groups of people&ndash;even governments&ndash;make decisions that involve trade-offs. A trade-off is the act of giving up one benefit in order to gain another, greater benefit. Trade-offs often involve things that can be easily measured, such as money, property, or time. But trade-offs may also involve values that are not so easy to measure. Such intangibles include enjoyment, job satisfaction, or the feeling of well-being that comes from helping somebody.

A few years from now, you might decide to turn down an exciting but low-paying job in favor of a less interesting job that pays better. Still later, you may choose to give up a vacation in order to put more money away for your retirement. Business Decisions The decisions that businesses make about how to use their factor resources&ndash;land, labor, and capital&ndash;also involve trade-offs. A farmer who plants broccoli cannot at the same time use the same area of land to grow squash. A furniture company that decides to use all of its equipment to make chairs eliminates the possibility of using the same equipment to build tables or desks. Government Decisions National, state, and local governments also make decisions that involve trade-offs. Economists and politicians use the term “guns or butter” to describe one of the common choices facing governments: the choice between spending money on military or domestic needs. A country that decides to produce more military goods (“guns”) has fewer resources to devote to consumer goods (“butter”) and vice versa. The steel needed to produce a tank cannot then be used to produce a tractor. >> The phrase “guns or butter” refers to the trade-off that governments make between military and domestic spending. Bounce to Activate Gallery For example, as the war in Afghanistan began drawing to a close in 2013, the United States began debating how to rein in military spending and government spending in general. One commentator described this debate: “Guns versus butter” has come back in vogue politically. “Guns” basically means spending on security concerns (military defense needs) as opposed to welfare pursuits or “butter” (education, hospitals, housing, schools, etc.). The choice for nations isn&apos;t usually either “guns” or “butter” but rather how many guns and how much butter . . . . But the question remains: How many guns are necessary to maintain a high level of security for the U.S., and how much butter can the nation afford without hurting guns and vice versa? &ndash;David Briceno, “‘Guns vs. Butter,&apos; America&apos;s Political Dilemma,” The Union In the end, the reason for the “guns or butter” trade-off is the same as the reason for any other trade-off: scarcity. Goods and services are limited, but our needs and wants are unlimited. dEfINE What are trade-offs? Opportunity Cost In most trade-off situations, one of the rejected alternatives is more desirable than the rest. The most desirable alternative somebody gives up as the result of a decision is the opportunity cost. Take the farmer in the example above. If squash is the most profitable alternative to broccoli, then the opportunity cost of deciding to plant broccoli is the chance to plant squash. Even simple decisions carry opportunity costs. Consider the following choices: Sleep late or wake up early to study for a test? Sleep late or wake up early to eat breakfast? Sleep late or wake up early to go on a ski trip? Most likely, you did not choose “sleep late” for all three decisions. Your decision depended on the specific opportunity cost&ndash;the value to you of what you were willing to sacrifice. 10 TOPIC 1 Fundamentals of Economics ]]></text>

Why? Bounce to Activate Chart Using a Decision-Making Grid At times, the opportunity cost of a decision may be unclear or complicated. Using a decision-making grid can help you determine whether you are willing to accept the opportunity cost of a choice you are about to make. In Figure 1.1, a high school student named Karen is trying to decide whether to sleep late or get up early to study for a test. Because of the scarcity of time, she cannot do both. To help her make her decision, Karen lists the benefits of each alternative on the grid. Waking up early to study will probably result in her receiving a better grade. She will also receive teacher and parental approval and experience a sense of personal satisfaction. On the other hand, Karen enjoys sleeping. In addition, the extra sleep would give her more energy during the day. She would have to give up these benefits if she decided to get up earlier. Making the Decision Karen is a practical person. After considering the opportunity cost of each alternative, she decides that waking up early to study offers her the most desirable benefits. She knows that she is giving up the pleasure of more sleep and the extra energy it would provide. But she is willing to accept this opportunity cost. If Karen faced other decisions with other opportunity costs, she might choose differently. What if the choice were between sleeping late and getting up early to have breakfast? What if her decision to sleep late or study were on a Saturday rather than on a school day? With each different set of alternatives, the possible benefits and opportunity costs change as well. One thing does not change, though. We always face an opportunity cost. As economists say, “Choosing is refusing.” When we select one alternative, we must sacrifice at least one other alternative and its benefits. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS Why does every choice involve an opportunity cost? Thinking at the Margin When economists look at decisions, they point out one more characteristic in addition to opportunity cost. Many decisions involve adding or subtracting one unit, such as one hour or one dollar. From an economist&apos;s point of view, when you decide how much more or less to do, you are thinking at the margin. To understand what it means to think at the margin, think about folding a piece of paper with important notes on it to put in your pocket. If you fold the paper in half and then in half again, it can just squeeze into your pocket and will lay fairly flat. If you continued folding it in half two or three more times, it would fit more easily in your pocket. But the paper would also become more bulky with each additional fold. The question is, how many folds is the best number for fitting easily into your pocket and laying flat once inside? Analyzing Costs and Benefits Deciding by thinking at the margin is just like making any other decision. Decision makers have to compare the opportunity costs and the benefits&ndash;what they will 1.2 Opportunity Cost and Trade-Offs 11 ]]></text>

Analyze Charts Do you agree with that decision? Why or why not? sacrifice and what they will gain. This decision- making process is sometimes called cost/benefit analysis. To make rational, or sensible, decisions at the margin, you must weigh marginal costs against marginal benefits. The marginal cost is the extra cost of adding one unit, whether it be sleeping one extra hour or building one extra house. The marginal benefit is the extra benefit of adding the same unit. As long as the marginal benefits exceed the marginal costs, it pays to add more units. Making Decisions at the Margin Look again at the example of Karen&apos;s decision on how late to sleep. The decision-making grid used an “all or nothing” approach. Either Karen was going to wake up early to study, or she was going to sleep late and not study at all that morning. In reality, Karen could have decided from among several options rather than just two. She could have decided to get up one, two, or three hours earlier. Making a decision about each extra hour would involve thinking at the margin. To make a decision at the margin, Karen should look at the marginal cost of each extra hour of studying and compare it to the marginal benefit. In Figure 1.2, we can see that one hour of studying means an opportunity cost of an hour of sleep, while the probable benefit would be passing the test with a C. Two hours of studying means losing two hours of sleep and perhaps getting a B. When Karen gives up three hours of sleep, however, the probable benefit rises only slightly, to a grade of B+. Karen concludes that the marginal cost of losing three hours of sleep is no longer worth the marginal benefit because her grade will improve only slightly. Based on her cost/benefit analysis, Karen decides to awaken two hours earlier. Like opportunity cost, thinking at the margin applies not just to individuals, but to businesses and governments as well. Employers think at the margin when they decide how many extra workers to hire. Legislators think at the margin when deciding how much to increase spending on a government program.

For nations, however, the consequences of these decisions can be far more serious. To decide what and how much to produce, economists use a tool known as a production possibilities curve. You will see how an imaginary country uses this tool to decide between producing two very different products: shoes and watermelons. Economists often use graphs to analyze the choices and trade- offs that people make. Why? Because graphs help us see how one value relates to another value. A production possibilities curve is a graph that shows alternative ways to use an economy&apos;s productive resources. The axes of the graph can show categories of goods and services, such as farm goods and factory goods or capital goods and consumer goods. The axes can also display any pair of specific goods or services, such as hats on one axis and shoes on the other.

Government economists in Capeland must decide whether to use the nation&apos;s scarce resources to manufacture shoes or to grow watermelons. The economists determine that, if Capeland used all of its resources to produce only shoes, it could produce 15 million pairs of shoes. At the other extreme, if Capeland used all of its resources to produce only watermelons, it could produce 21 million tons of watermelons. The Capeland economists use this information to create a production possibilities curve (Figure 1.3). The vertical axis of the graph represents how many millions of pairs of shoes Capeland&apos;s factories can produce. The horizontal axis shows how many millions of tons of watermelons Capeland&apos;s farmers can grow. At point a, Capeland is producing 15 million pairs of shoes but no watermelons. At point c, Capeland is producing 21 million tons of watermelons but no shoes. There is a third, more likely alternative. The citizens of Capeland can use their resources to produce both shoes and watermelons. The table shows four different ways that Capelanders could use their resources to produce both shoes and watermelons. Using the made-up data from the table, we can plot points on the graph. This line, called the production possibilities frontier, shows combinations of the production of both shoes and watermelons. Any spot on that line represents a point at which Capeland is using all of its resources to produce a maximum combination of those two products. Production Possibilities Curve Trade-Offs Along the Production Possibilities Frontier Each point on the production possibilities frontier reflects a trade-off. Near the top of the curve, factories produce more shoes, but farms grow fewer watermelons. Farther down the curve, farms grow more watermelons, but factories make fewer pairs of shoes. These trade-offs are necessary because factors of production are scarce. Using land, labor, and capital to make one product means that fewer resources are left to make something else. dEfINE Why is a production possibilities curve helpful to economists? Changing Production Possibilities Production possibilities curves give useful information. They can show how efficient an economy is, whether an economy is growing, and the opportunity cost of producing more of one good or service. Efficiency A production possibilities frontier represents an economy working at its most efficient level. Efficiency is the use of resources in such a way as to maximize the output of goods and services. However, sometimes economies operate inefficiently. For example, suppose some workers were laid off. The farms or factories where they worked would produce fewer goods.

Bounce to Activate 3D Model economic policies that a nation enacts can also affect efficiency. For example, if laws that lowered manufacturing costs were passed, the businesses might hire back those laid-off workers. In that case, the economy could become more efficient and return to the production possibilities frontier. Any point inside the production possibilities frontier indicates underutilization, or the use of fewer resources than the economy is capable of using. At point b in Figure 1.4, Capeland is growing 5 million tons of watermelons and making 8 million pairs of shoes. This is inefficient because it is less than the maximum possible production. Growth A production possibilities curve is a snapshot. It reflects current production possibilities as if a country&apos;s resources were frozen in time. In the real world, however, available resources are constantly changing. If the quantity or quality of land, labor, or capital changes, then the curve will move. For example, a wave of immigration may increase a nation&apos;s labor supply. This rise in a factor of production increases the maximum amount of goods the nation can produce. When an economy grows, economists say that the production possibilities frontier has “shifted to the right.” To see such a shift, look at line c in Figure 1.4. Notice that the possible output of both shoes and watermelons has increased at each point along the line. However, when a country&apos;s production capacity decreases, the curve shifts to the left. A decrease could occur, for example, when a country goes to war and loses part of its land as a result. Opportunity Cost We can also use production possibilities graphs to determine the cost involved in a decision. Remember that cost does not necessarily mean money. To an economist, cost nearly always means opportunity cost. Looking at the production possibilities table for Capeland, we can see that the opportunity cost of moving from producing no watermelons to producing 8 million tons of watermelons is 1 million pairs of shoes. In other words, in order to produce 8 million tons of watermelons, Capeland had to sacrifice the opportunity to produce 1 million pairs of shoes. In the same way, if Capeland later decides to increase watermelon production from 8 million tons to 14 million tons&ndash;an increase of only 6 million tons&ndash;it costs 2 million pairs of shoes. In the first step, those 8 million tons of watermelons cost 1 million pairs of shoes. In the second step, an increase of only 6 million tons of watermelons costs an additional 2 million pairs of shoes. This amounts to 3 million pairs of shoes for 14 million tons of watermelons. Every additional step of switching from shoes to watermelons has an increasing cost. Each time Capeland grows more watermelons, the sacrifice in terms of shoes increases. Eventually, it costs Capeland an additional 5 million pairs of shoes to increase watermelon production by only 1 million tons. 1.3 Production Possibilities 15 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="82"> <text><![CDATA[ >> Automation, the use of equipment that runs largely on its own, increases efficiency. Analyze Political Cartoons What concern might the cartoonist be expressing about this technology? Economists explain these increasingly expensive trade-offs through the law of increasing costs. This principle states that as production shifts from making one item to another, more and more resources are necessary to increase production of the second item. Therefore, the opportunity cost increases. Why does the cost increase? The reason is that some resources are better suited for use in farming while others are more appropriate for manufacturing. Moving resources from factory to farm production means that farmers must use resources that are not as suitable for farming. For example, when deciding to produce 8 million tons of watermelons, Capeland devoted its most fertile land to this crop. That shift used up the country&apos;s best land, so with each additional step, farmers had to use poorer land that produced less per acre than the fertile land could. To increase output on the poorer land, farmers had to use more land and other resources. This left even fewer resources for producing shoes. The law of increasing costs explains why production possibilities curve. As we move along the curve, we trade off more and more for less and less added output. Technology and Training When economists collect data to create production possibilities curves, they must first determine which goods and services a country can produce with its current resources. A country&apos;s resources include its land and natural resources, its workforce, and its physical and human capital. Both human and physical capital reflect a vital ingredient of economic growth&ndash;technology. Technology is the process used to create goods and services. At any time, countries have used different forms of technology to produce shoes or watermelons or any of the thousands of products that are made. So economists must assess each country&apos;s level of technological know-how. Do workers in Capeland pick watermelons by hand? Do they use assembly lines to make shoes? Technology is one of the factors that can increase a nation&apos;s efficiency. Therefore, many governments spend money investing in new technology. For the same reason, they may also invest in education and training so that people can develop and use new technologies. Highly skilled workers can increase efficiency and lead to economic growth.

Lesson 1: Scarcity Lesson 3: Production Possibilities LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.1 LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.2 Scarcity exists because there is a limited amount of goods and services available to meet people&apos;s needs. Scarcity affects the factors of production, or the resources used to make goods and services. These factors of production are land, labor, and capital. Capital is any human-made resource that is used to make goods and services and includes both human capital, or education and experience, and physical capital, such as buildings and machinery. Lesson 2: Opportunity Cost and Trade-Offs LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, LAFS.1112.WHST.3.9, SS.912.E.1.7 Making and distributing goods and services requires many decisions. Decisions involve trade-offs between one possibility and another. Opportunity cost, or the cost of giving up one option for another, shape economic decisions. Economic decisions also involve thinking at the margin&ndash;that is, thinking about the cost and benefit of adding one more item or subtracting an item. Production possibilities&ndash;which are limited by scarcity and trade-offs&ndash;can be shown graphically for two categories of products in a production possibilities curve. The curve shows the production possibilities frontier, or the amount of each category that can produced in an economy with the most efficient possible use of resources. If a society can increase the supply of resources or find ways to use them more efficiently, then the production possibilities frontier rises, and economic growth results. ]]></text>

How people answer these questions shapes our freedom of choice&ndash;and what we have to choose from. Resources are scarce everywhere. As a result, every society must answer three basic economic questions: &bull; What goods and services should be produced? &bull; How should these goods and services be produced? &bull; Who consumes these goods and services? The way a society answers these questions defines its economic system. An economic system is the structure of methods and principles a society uses to produce and distribute goods and services.

How Should Goods and Services Be Produced? A society must also decide how to produce goods and services. Is education best delivered through public schools or private schools? What fuel should we use to generate electricity&ndash;oil, solar power, or nuclear power? Although there are many ways to produce goods and services, all require land, labor, and capital. These factors of production can be combined in different ways. For example, look at Figure 2.1. Before the introduction of modern farming equipment, producing 15 bushels of wheat may have required 56 hours of labor, 1 acre of land, and simple hand tools. Today, mechanical equipment and other technologies make farming more efficient. Farmers can use just 2.9 hours of labor to produce 40 bushels of wheat on that same acre of land. While the amount of land used remains the same, labor has gone down, and the amount of capital needed has gone up. These decisions involve trade-offs, too. What else could the society produce with those 56 hours of work in the time of hand tools? What could today&apos;s society make if the capital employed as mechanized farm equipment were used in some other way? Who Consumes the Goods and Services That Are Produced? Societies also make decisions that determine how goods and services are consumed. How can people meet their needs for food and medical care? Who gets to drive a new luxury car and who can only afford bus fare? Who gets access to a college education? The answers to such questions are largely determined by how societies distribute income. Factor payments are the income people receive in return for supplying factors of production&ndash;land, labor, or capital. Landowners collect rent, workers earn wages, and those who lend money receive payments called interest. Factor payments also include the profits that entrepreneurs earn if their enterprises succeed. Profit is the amount of money a business receives in excess of its expenses. Profits are the rewards entrepreneurs receive for taking the risk of starting a business. How much should we pay the owners of the factors of production? How do we decide how much teachers should earn versus how much doctors should earn? The answers to such questions tell us a great deal about a society&apos;s values. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS What are the three basic economic questions?

    <page pageNumber="94"> <text><![CDATA[ Economic Goals of Society Different societies answer the three economic questions based on the importance they attach to various economic goals. These goals include efficiency, freedom, security, equity, and growth. All societies pursue each of these goals to some degree. Efficiency Because resources are always scarce, societies try to maximize what they can produce using the resources they have. If a society can accurately assess what its people need and want, it increases its economic efficiency. A manufacturer would be wasting resources producing desktop computers if people prefer laptops. The goal of reducing waste also involves the second and third economic questions. Producers seek better ways to create goods and to make them available to consumers. An economy that cannot deliver the right goods in the right quantity to the right people at the right price is not efficient. Freedom Most people value the opportunity to make their own choices. Still, people all over the world face limits to their economic freedom. Americans face limits as well. But in general, individual freedom is a key cultural value for Americans. We prize the freedom to buy what we can pay for, to seek work where we want, to own property, and to become entrepreneurs. In order to obtain these benefits, we accept the costs that come with freedom&ndash;for example, the potential of failure. Not everyone is able to prosper, and some people experience poverty. Security Most people do not like uncertainty. We want to know we can get milk or bread every time we go to the store. We want the security of knowing we will get our paychecks every payday. Ideally, economic systems seek to reassure people that goods and services will be available when needed and that expected payments will arrive on time. We also want the security of knowing that help is available if we are in need. Many governments provide a safety net, or set of programs to protect people who face unfavorable economic conditions such as layoffs, injuries, or natural disasters. Many countries also provide some sort of base income for retired persons to ensure that they can support themselves in retirement. Equity Equity, or fairness, is another economic goal that is defined differently in different societies. (See Figure 2.2 for information about one measure of equity in the United States in recent years.) Each society must decide how to divide its economic pie.

How much should society provide for those who are unable or unwilling to produce? How are the benefits of economic freedom compromised by the goal of economic equity&ndash;or is inequity possibly a cost of freedom? Growth A nation&apos;s economy must grow with its population so it can provide jobs for the new people joining the workforce. A nation&apos;s economy must grow if people are going to have more income. When that occurs, the nation improves its standard of living, or level of economic prosperity. Innovation plays a huge role in economic growth. Innovation is the process of bringing new methods, products, or ideas into use. During the Industrial Revolution of the 1700s and 1800s, innovations in technology increased the efficiency of production and introduced new goods and services. Many problems arose, such as harsh conditions in factories and crowded cities, as well as increased pollution of air and water. Yet, the Industrial Revolution also sparked economic growth and led to an overall rise in standards of living. Today, innovations in computer and networking technology are changing how people work, do business, find information, and communicate. Conflicting Economic Goals A society may value goals other than these. Environmental protection, full employment, or protecting national industries may be among a nation&apos;s chief economic goals. Sometimes, economic goals conflict with one another. For example, when a society provides a safety net for all citizens, the added cost may slow economic growth. To protect the environment, a government may impose regulations on manufacturers that curb economic freedom. Thus, all nations must prioritize their economic goals, or arrange them in order of importance. Each choice comes with some kind of trade-off. Choosing among conflicting economic goals is a basic economic problem that every society must face. Traditional Economies Societies have developed four different economic systems to address the three basic economic questions. Each system reflects a different prioritization of economic goals. It also reflects the values of the societies in which these systems are found. The oldest and simplest of economic systems is the traditional economy. A traditional economy relies on habit, custom, or ritual to answer the three >> This U.S. National Guard soldier is helping to deliver aid to victims of a storm.

The traditional economic system revolves around the family unit&ndash;often an extended family made up of several generations. Work tends to be divided along gender lines. Boys tend to take up the occupations of their fathers, while girls follow those of their mothers. Traditional economies are usually found in communities that tend to stay relatively small and close. Often people in these societies work to support the entire community, rather than just themselves or their immediate families. In these societies, agricultural and hunting practices usually lie at the center of people&apos;s lives, laws, and religious beliefs. Societies with traditional economies are economically successful if they meet their own needs. But they have few mechanisms to deal effectively with the effects of environmental disaster, such as a flood or drought. They also tend to be slow to adopt new ideas or technology. They may not have access to a wide range of goods. In most cases, these communities lack modern conveniences and have a relatively low standard of living.

You will soon see how the free market affects every household and community in the United States, including yours. Markets Defined What do a farmer&apos;s market, a sporting goods store, the New York Stock Exchange, and a community bulletin board where you posted a sign advertising baby-sitting services have in common? All are examples of markets. A market is any arrangement that allows buyers and sellers to exchange things. Markets eliminate the need for any one person to be self- sufficient. None of us produces all we require to satisfy our needs and wants. You probably did not grow cotton plants, process that cotton into cloth, or weave that cloth into the shirt you are wearing. Instead, you purchased your shirt at a store. Markets allow us to exchange the things we have for the things we want. The Role of Specialization Instead of being self-sufficient, each of us specializes in a few products or services.

Specialization leads to efficiency in the use of capital, land, and labor. It is better for people to learn one task or a few tasks very well than to learn a little about many tasks. Because they concentrate on one or a few tasks, they can do their work more efficiently, saving resources by avoiding waste. For this reason, the top performers in most fields are specialists who have worked hard to sharpen their particular skills. Specialization also benefits businesses. Focusing on a limited number of related products or services allows them to use their limited capital and labor more efficiently. Buying and Selling People in primitive cultures had to make everything they needed from materials they gathered from nature. Even in more recent times, some people strive for self-sufficiency. However, because most of us in the modern world specialize in producing just a few goods or services, we need a mechanism that allows us to sell what we have produced and to buy what we want. Figure 2.3 illustrates this concept. In a modern market-based economy, people typically earn income by specializing in particular jobs. They then use this income to buy the products that they want to consume. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS Why do markets exist? Elements of a Free Market Economy In a free market economy, answers to the three basic economic questions are made by voluntary exchange in markets. The choices made by individuals determine what gets made, how it is made, and how much people can consume of the goods and services produced. Individuals and businesses make their own decisions about what to buy or sell. Market economies are also called capitalist economies because the capital that entrepreneurs invest in businesses is a vital part of the system. In a free market system, individuals and privately owned businesses own the factors of production, make what they want, and buy what they want. In other words, individuals answer the three basic >> Figure 2.3 This farmer specializes in raising one crop, using income from its sale to purchase equipment and other goods.

Analyze Charts What is the primary item that changes hands in the monetary flow? Bounce to Activate 3D Model questions of what to produce, how to produce it, and who consumes what is produced. The United States has a free market economic system. This system is commonly referred to as the United States free enterprise system. In general, free enterprise, free market, and capitalism are all synonyms for the economic system of the United States. Households and Firms The participants in a free market economy are households and firms. A household is a person or group of people living in a single residence. Households own the factors of production&ndash;land, labor, and capital. They are also consumers of goods and services. A business, or firm, is an organization that uses resources to produce a product or service, which it then sells. Firms transform inputs, or factors of production, into outputs, or goods and services. We can represent the exchanges that take place in a free market economy in a diagram called a circular flow model. Look at Figure 2.4. The diagram shows how households and firms exchange money, resources, and products in the marketplace. The inner ring of the diagram represents the flow of resources and products. Note that both households and firms are resource owners in this model. The outer ring represents the flow of money. Factor and Product Markets As you can see from the lower half of the model, firms purchase factors of production from households. This arena of exchange is called the factor market. An example of this is when firms purchase or rent land. They hire workers, paying them wages or salaries for their labor. They also borrow money from households to purchase capital, paying households interest or profits in return. Now look at the top half of the circular flow model. The arena in which households buy the goods and services that firms produce is the product market. So, when you buy food at a supermarket, you are taking part in the product market physical flow. If you follow the rings of the diagram, you will see that in the product market, households purchase the products made by firms with the money they receive from firms in the factor market. The monetary and physical flows through the factor and product markets are truly circular. ExPRESS IdEAS CLEARLy What is the role of firms in the free market economy? 2.2 Free Markets 33 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="100"> <text><![CDATA[ How Markets Self- Regulate Firms and households usually cooperate to give each other what they want&ndash;factor resources from households to firms, and goods and services from firms to households. Why should they cooperate when we live in such a competitive society? According to Adam Smith, competition and our own self-interest actually help to keep the marketplace functioning. Self-Interest Adam Smith was a Scottish social philosopher. In 1776, he published a book titled The Wealth of Nations that described how markets function. Smith observed that an economy is made up of countless individual transactions. In each of these exchanges, the buyer and seller consider only their own self-interest, that is, their own personal gain. Smith observed: Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want . . . and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good [services] which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. &ndash;Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations Self-interest, in other words, is the motivating force in the free market&ndash;the push that leads people to act. Incentives and Competition Consumers, pursuing their self-interest, have the incentive to look for lower prices. Look at Figure 2.5. An incentive is the hope of reward or fear of penalty that encourages a person to behave in a certain way. Many incentives are monetary, or based on money, such as the promise of higher wages or profits. Others are nonmonetary, such as the prestige and personal satisfaction one gets from running a successful business. Adam Smith observed that people respond in a predictable way to both positive and negative incentives. Consumers, for instance, will respond to the positive incentive of lower prices by buying WHAT ARE INCENTIVES? RESPONSE NEGATIVE INCENTIVE POSITIVE INCENTIVE Maria&apos;s parents promise to buy her concert tickets if she improves her grades. Maria spends more time studying for school.

Analyze Charts Which of the advantages of the free market do you think is most important to producers? Explain your answer. more goods, because spending less money on a good lowers the opportunity cost of the purchase. Firms, meanwhile, seek to make higher profits by increasing sales. Let&apos;s take, for example, a shirt manufacturer. The manufacturer finds that striped shirts are far outselling polka-dotted shirts. The manufacturer has the incentive&ndash;from more potential sales and profits&ndash;to produce more striped shirts. Other manufacturers, seeing consumers&apos; desire for striped shirts, also have the incentive to make those shirts. Now consumers can get all the striped shirts they want&ndash;but what will it cost them? What if all these producers charged high prices for those shirts so they could maximize their profits? The fact that there are so many producers helps to discourage that. Suppose most manufacturers charge $30.00 for a striped shirt, while one decides to sell them for $25.00. Consumers, pursuing their self-interest, will buy the lower-priced shirt. If the other manufacturers want to sell more striped shirts, they will have to drop the price. Economists call this struggle among producers for the dollars of consumers competition. While self-interest is the motivating force behind the free market, competition is the regulating force. Price Competition and Non-price Competition When shirt manufacturers lower the price of a shirt to compete with one another, this is an example of price competition. Price competition takes place when producers compete to offer the lowest price for a good that is identical to goods made by other producers. Producers also engage in non-price competition. Non-price competition occurs when producers compete by offering higher-quality goods or goods with different features. A shirt manufacture might sell a shirt for the same price as other manufacturers but might compete by using higher-quality cloth or a more fashionable design. This would be an example of non-price competition. The Invisible Hand Self-interest and competition tend to work together to keep the marketplace fair and its prices responsive. Self-interest spurs consumers to purchase certain goods and services and firms to produce them. Competition causes firms to produce more and moderates their desire to raise prices. As a result, consumers usually get the products they want at prices that more closely reflect the cost of producing them. That is, prices are responsive to market forces rather than to the choices of individual producers. All of this happens without any central planning or direction. No consumer or producer has made decisions based on what&apos;s good for the marketplace, yet the end result is a marketplace that operates 2.2 Free Markets 35 ]]></text>

Adam Smith called this self-regulating mechanism the “invisible hand” of the marketplace. dRAw CONCLUSIONS What does competition among producers in a free market accomplish for consumers? Advantages of a Free Market As you saw, each society tries to achieve a variety of economic goals. Under ideal conditions, the free market meets many of these goals&ndash;summarized in Figure 2.6&ndash;on its own. 1. Economic efficiency Because it is self- regulating, a free market economy such as the U.S. free enterprise system can respond efficiently to rapidly changing conditions. Producers attempt to provide only the goods and services that consumers want, and at prices consumers are willing to pay. 2. Economic freedom Free market economies have the highest degree of economic freedom of any system. For example, in the U.S. free enterprise system, workers work where they want, firms produce what they want, and individuals consume what they want. 3. Economic growth Because competition encourages innovation, free markets encourage growth. Entrepreneurs in the U.S. free enterprise system are always seeking profitable opportunities, contributing new ideas and innovations. 4. Additional goals Free markets, such as the U.S. free enterprise system, offer a wider variety of goods and services than any other system, because producers have incentives to meet consumers&apos; desires. Consumers, in essence, have the power to decide what gets produced. This is called consumer sovereignty. The free enterprise system of the United States illustrates the many advantages of a free market system. Despite the advantages, however, no country today operates under a pure, unregulated free market system. There are several reasons for this. For example, some societies have goals that are not always easy to achieve in a pure market system, such as economic equity or security. Later you will read about how countries modify the free market system in order to better meet the entire array of economic goals.

In it, Smith argued against the prevailing theory of mercantilism, which claimed that nations should restrict trade in order to gain wealth. The Wealth of Nations was based in part on observations of Britain&apos;s economy during the Industrial Revolution. It continues to influence economists today. . . . . In almost every other race of animals each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is entirely independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance of no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. . . . It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. . . . determine meaning What does Smith mean by “self-love,” and what role does it play in cooperation between people? As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need of, so it is this same trucking disposition [disposition for making deals] which originally gives occasion to the division of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds a particular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness and >> Adam Smith dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison with his companions; and he finds at last that he can in this manner get more cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house- carpenter. . . . explain an argument What is the division of labor, and how does Smith say it came about? As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it.

Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. . . . identify main ideas What is the “invisible hand” that Smith mentions, and how does he think it helps society? What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every individual, it is evident, can, in his local situation, judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him. . . . To give the monopoly of the home-market to the produce of domestic industry, in any particular art or manufacture, is in some measure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and must, in almost all cases, be either a useless or a hurtful regulation. If the produce of domestic can be brought there as cheap as that of foreign industry, the regulation is evidently useless. If it cannot, it must generally be hurtful. It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The taylor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes, but employs a taylor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor the other, but employs those different artificers.

One reason is that the two countries have different economic systems. Cuba does not have a market economy, but a centrally planned one. Societies that rely on central planning answer the basic economic questions differently from those that depend on market principles. In a centrally planned economy, the government, rather than individual producers and consumers, answers the three basic questions; a central bureaucracy decides what items to produce, how to produce them, and who gets them. The government owns both land and capital. In a sense it owns labor, too, because it controls where people work and what they are paid. The government directs workers to produce a certain number of trucks, so many yards of cotton fabric, and so on. Farmers are told what to plant and where to send their crops.

As you will read shortly, communism and Communism Differ socialism are two examples of economic systems that feature central planning. To see how such an economy works, we will follow the decision-making process for the production of uniforms for members of the military and the production of sweaters for consumers. 1. The top planners decide that more military uniforms than sweaters will be made. They send this decision to the materials committee. 2. Knowing how much cotton is available, the materials committee decides how many uniforms and sweaters to produce. They send their decision to the makers of cotton, buttons, and elastic. 3. The cotton, the buttons, and the elastic arrive at factories, where they are used to make uniforms and sweaters. Clearly, there is no consumer sovereignty under centrally planned economies. Many people might need new sweaters but be unable to buy them because the sweaters were not produced. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS What is the process by which basic economic decisions are made in a centrally planned economy? The terms most often linked to central planning are socialism and communism. Though often used interchangeably, the terms actually describe different systems, as described in Figure 2.7. Socialism Socialism is not a single economic system. Rather, the term describes a range of economic and political systems based on the belief that wealth should be evenly distributed throughout society. Economic equity, socialists argue, can exist only if the centers of economic power are controlled by the government or by the public as a whole, rather than by individuals or corporations. In some nations, such as Sweden, socialism coexists with free market practices. Under this “market socialism,” the government uses its powers of taxation to redistribute wealth and provide extensive services. Other socialists stress government ownership of the means of production. They consider socialism to be an intermediate stage between capitalism and communism. Communism In the 1800s, socialism gave rise to communism. Under communism, the central government owns and controls all resources and means of production and makes all economic decisions.

Identify Central Issues How does this graph represent the concept of central planning? Communism derived largely from the writings of German philosopher Karl Marx. Unlike Adam Smith, who stressed mutually beneficial relations between producers and consumers, Marx stressed the conflict between labor and capital. He believed that labor was the source of all value. But under capitalism, he said, all the profit created by the labor of workers ended up in the hands of capitalists, such as factory owners: Capitalist production . . . develops technology and the combining together of various processes . . . only by sapping the original sources of all wealth&ndash;the soil and the laborer. &ndash;Karl Marx, The Communist Manifesto The inevitable result of capitalism, Marx argued, was the exploitation of workers and an unfair distribution of wealth. Marx and later communists believed that a socialist society could only result from a violent revolution. While countries with socialist economies can be democratic, communist governments have always been authoritarian. Authoritarian governments limit individual freedoms and require strict obedience from their citizens. Every communist nation has been dominated by a single dictator or political party. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS What beliefs did Karl Marx hold about capitalism? Two Communist Economies During the twentieth century, communist revolutions occurred in several countries. The histories of two of these nations, the Soviet Union and China, reveal key features of centrally planned economies. The Soviet Union In 1917, revolutionaries toppled the Russian government. Once in power, they renamed themselves communists, instituted a reign of terror, and murdered the former czar and his family. They also initiated a radical economic program. This marked the beginning of what became the Soviet Union, the world&apos;s first communist state. In 1928, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin imposed the first in a series of strict five-year plans to boost industrial and agricultural production. (See Figure 2.8.) Until it broke up in 1991, the Soviet Union continued to operate as a command economy. Soviet economic planners sought to build national power and prestige. They allocated the best land, 2.3 Centrally Planned Economies 41 ]]></text>

Heavy industry requires large capital investment and produces goods, such as chemicals or steel, used in other industries. The decision to favor heavy industry had a harsh effect on factories that made consumer goods. They were stuck with leftover, lower-quality resources. As a result, the goods available to consumers were few in number and poorly made. Severe shortages were common. Agriculture faced similar problems. Farmers were forced to work on large, state-run farms. The government supplied all materials and set all wages. The results were often disastrous. While Russia had been a major exporter of wheat, the Soviet Union could not always produce enough grain to feed its own people. Heavy industry and military might helped make the Soviet Union a world superpower, especially after World War II. But in time, economic weaknesses contributed to the fall of communism and the collapse of the state. China Like Russia, China adopted central planning as the result of a communist revolution. From 1949 to the late 1970s, government planners controlled every aspect of the Chinese economy. At first, the communist government allowed some farmland to remain in private hands while it focused China&apos;s Grain Output, 1956–1963 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 193 million metric tons 195 million metric tons 200 million metric tons 170 million metric tons 143 million metric tons 148 million metric tons 160 million metric tons 170 million metric tons on building industry. The government tried to build small factories to produce goods to be sold in nearby areas. But these goods were expensive to make and of very poor quality. In the 1950s, the government forced many peasants onto farming communes. Within a few years, farm production dropped sharply, as shown in Figure 2.9. Facing shortages, the government eased its control over decisions made by workers on the communes. It also sent many factory workers to work on farms. The food crisis was solved, but China&apos;s economy continued to stumble. Chinese leaders began to institute new economic policies in the 1970s. They gave farmers the chance to own more land and offered bonuses to factory managers for making better quality products. As a result, China&apos;s economy began to grow. Today, the Chinese government still owns firms in major industries. Government planners control many key economic decisions. Still, China allows entrepreneurs far more economic freedom than in the past. Such changes have given a tremendous boost to China&apos;s economy.

    <page pageNumber="109"> <text><![CDATA[ Disadvantages of Central Planning Despite the differences between centrally planned and free market economies, the two systems share many of the same basic goals. However, nations with centrally planned economies have often had trouble meeting these goals in practice. 1. Economic efficiency In a centrally planned economy, the government owns all production factors. Since the government fixes wages, workers lack the incentive to work faster or produce more. The large, complex bureaucracy needed to make thousands of economic decisions hurts efficiency as well. It is expensive to run and lacks the flexibility to adjust quickly to consumer demands and changing economic conditions. 2. Economic freedom Traditionally, command economies sacrifice individual freedoms in order to pursue societal goals. Sometimes, the results have been brutal; millions of peasants were killed in Stalin&apos;s drive to reform Soviet agriculture. But even in better circumstances, central planning discourages competition and takes most or all economic choices away from producers and consumers. 3. Economic growth Innovation is a key to economic growth. Command economies, however, do not tend to reward innovation&ndash;in fact, they discourage change. Managers must follow an approved government plan. There is no profit incentive to encourage entrepreneurship. 4. Economic equity In theory, a major goal of communism is to increase equity by distributing goods and services fairly. Such equity has proven rare, though. Government officials and people in favored careers enjoy higher incomes and access to a wider variety of higher-quality goods. Ordinary people often suffer shortages and poorly made goods. 5. Additional goals Central planning has successfully met some goals. It can guarantee jobs and income. It can also be used to jump-start selected industries. For example, Stalin&apos;s five-year plans did increase output in heavy industries. The disadvantages of central planning have caused leaders in many countries to move away from command economies and toward mixed economies.

Why Government Gets Involved in the Economy Every economic system has inherent problems in addressing the three basic economic questions. Traditional economies have little potential for growth or change. Centrally planned economies stifle innovation, do not adequately meet consumer needs, and limit freedom. Even free market economies, with all their advantages, have drawbacks. Early free market thinkers such as Adam Smith believed that, left alone, the free market would provide the greatest benefit for consumers and raise the standard of living. They favored laissez faire, the doctrine that government generally should not intervene in the marketplace. Yet even Smith acknowledged the need for a limited degree of government involvement. Since Smith&apos;s time, government intervention has increased for several reasons. First, some needs of modern society would VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="111"> <text><![CDATA[ be difficult to meet in the marketplace. How well, for example, could a free market provide for national defense or highway systems? In addition, governments supply some needs in order to achieve the goal of equity and ensure that all members of society can benefit. For instance, a society could rely solely on private schools to educate its children, but then some families could not afford to send their children to school. To make sure that all members of society receive a basic education, government in the United States provides public schools. Another example that some governments place in this category is mass transit. Governments today also play a role in the economy by protecting property rights. For instance, the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments to the Constitution declare that no person may be deprived of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” These amendments protect private property, or property owned by individuals or companies and not by the government or the people as a whole. The government also protects private property with laws that give individuals control over intellectual property such as books, songs, or movies they have created. Private property is a fundamental element of the American economic system. Governments try to make sure that exchanges in the marketplace are fair. For instance, laws require businesses to give honest information to consumers and block firms from joining together to prevent competition and fix prices. Finally, people&apos;s preferences for redistribution of income have changed. Some governments tax individuals and businesses to fund pension payments for retired workers, those who cannot work because of disabilities, and others. For all of these reasons, no nation today has a pure free market or command economy. Most economies are mixed. A mixed economy is an economic system that has some market-based elements and some government involvement. The degree of government involvement varies from nation to nation. Balancing Government Involvement and Economic Freedom As you have seen, every society must assess its values and prioritize its economic goals. Some goals are better met by the open market, others through government action. In addition, societies must evaluate the opportunity cost of pursuing each goal. What are you willing to give up?

To give all people an education? Questions like these can spark heated debate. IdENTIfy What is one reason that governments have become involved in otherwise market-based economies? Circular Flow Model of a Mixed Economy To illustrate accurately how most modern economies work, we must add government to our circular flow diagram (Figure 2.10). Government enters this flow and interacts with resource owners&ndash;firms and households&ndash;in a variety of ways. Government Actions in the Factor Market As you saw in Figure 2.4, firms purchase land, labor, and capital from households in the factor market. The same is true of governments. For example, the U.S. government pays nearly 3 million employees over $150 billion a year for their labor. State and local governments also employ large numbers of people. Every time a police officer gets a paycheck, a local government is buying labor in the factor market. The same is true of federal workers like park rangers, scientists, and janitors who clean the halls of Congress. Government Actions in the Product Market Like households, governments purchase goods and services from firms in the product market. Government offices need telephones and computers. Printing money requires many tons of paper and gallons of ink. Governments buy services like consulting and waste removal. The vast majority of these purchases are made from private firms. Governments also provide certain goods and services by combining the factor resources they have purchased. The federal, state, and local governments, for example, have used concrete, steel, and other products to build nearly 4 million miles of roads. Governments provide police and fire protection, education, and health care services as well. Government Actions Transferring Money Governments collect taxes from both households and businesses.

In recent years, the United States government has paid out over a trillion dollars in Social Security and Medicare benefits annually. Describe How do government actions affect the product market? Mixed Economies Today Most modern economies are mixed economies. Governments are involved to some degree, but some are involved more deeply than others. You can see these differences in Figure 2.12, which shows a range of mixed economies in today&apos;s world. Mixed Economies with Heavy Government Involvement North Korea represents one extreme of the continuum. Like the former Soviet Union, communist North Korea has an economy almost totally dominated by the government. The government owns all property and all economic output. State-owned industries produce 95 percent of North Korea&apos;s goods. Imports are almost totally banned, and production by foreign companies is forbidden. In China, government long dominated the economy. But in recent decades, China&apos;s leaders have loosened their control of the economy, allowing more private ownership of farms and businesses. They have also become more willing to permit foreign firms to invest and operate in China. As a result, China&apos;s place on the continuum is closer to the center than North Korea&apos;s. Like many nations that relied on central planning in the past, China is now going through an economic transition, a period in which a nation moves from one economic system to another. In China&apos;s case, the transition involves privatizing state-owned firms. Privatization means selling enterprises operated by the government to individuals. Mixed Economies Tending Toward Free Markets At the far right of the continuum in Figure 2.12, with one of the world&apos;s freest markets, is Singapore. The government of this small nation encourages foreign trade and investment while imposing few regulations on commercial activity. This has resulted in strong and steady economic growth in recent years. Hong Kong is another example of a far-eastern free market powerhouse. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. The Chinese government allows Hong Kong to operate largely under a free market economic system. The government protects private property and rarely interferes in the free market. recall Why is China&apos;s economy considered more mixed than North Korea&apos;s? 2.4 Mixed Economies 47 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="114"> <text><![CDATA[ The Economy of the United States While the American economy is a mixed system, the foundation of the United States economy is the free market. The United States free enterprise system is characterized by individual or corporate ownership of capital goods. Investments in firms are made in a free market by private decision. The Role of the Government The government of the United States plays a substantial role in the American economy. The American government keeps order, provides vital services, and promotes the general welfare. Federal and state laws protect private property. The marketplace operates with a limited degree of government regulation and some limits government places on business use of private property. For instance, local laws may allow businesses to operate only in certain areas and not in a residential district. A company planning to shut down a facility may not freely do so if it has 100 or more employees. Federal law requires such a firm to give employees 60 days warning if that shutdown will result in job loss. Some Americans argue that there is a need for more government services and stricter regulation of business. They want greater regulation of employment practices to protect workers or of business processes to protect consumers or the environment. Many others, however, say that the government already intervenes too much in the economy. They call for relaxation of existing regulations, arguing that government rules drive up the operating and administrative costs of businesses, making them less efficient and less competitive. Overall Economic Freedom Households and businesses in the United States enjoy a high level of economic freedom&ndash;with a few limits. (See Figure 2.13.) Individuals can choose what kind of work they want to do (how they wish to enter the factor market for labor) and where they want to live (where they enter that market). Entrepreneurs have the freedom to launch and expand businesses. Both new and existing businesses have the ability to engage in whatever business they want and operate where they want. Though oversight of the banking industry changed somewhat after the 2008 financial crisis, the industry still operates under relatively few restrictions compared to most other nations.

    <page pageNumber="117"> <text><![CDATA[ economic prosperity. Today, there are over 27 million businesses in America, including 6 million that are owned by members of minority groups. Many of these were started by a single entrepreneur or a small group of friends or family members. Why has America been such an economic success? Certainly the United States enjoys many advantages in resources: open land; large reserves of natural resources; and a large, talented labor supply. But a key factor has also been the American tradition of free enterprise&ndash;the social and political commitment to giving people the freedom and flexibility to try out their business ideas and compete in the marketplace. This free enterprise system has several basic characteristics. Incentives Why do consumers look for lower prices when they shop? That behavior can save them money. Why do workers seek higher wages? That behavior can help them enjoy a better life. Lower prices and higher wages are incentives for consumers and workers to act in certain ways. An incentive is a reward or a cost resulting from specific behavior. For firms, a major incentive is profit. They try to boost their productivity, increase sales, and maintain competitive prices in order to gain the reward of higher profits. Incentives often involve money, although they can be nonmonetary. For example, the happiness that comes with finding a bargain is an incentive for a consumer to shop. Personal satisfaction is an incentive for an owner to work and build his or her business. Incentives are often positive, in the form of rewards, but they can also be negative, in the form of costs or penalties. Higher prices for goods and services, for example, are a negative incentive for consumers, as are higher sales taxes. Both can lead consumers to buy less. Higher income taxes can be an incentive for workers to work fewer hours. Profit Motive The American economy rests on recognition of the profit motive as a key incentive. The profit motive drives individuals and businesses to make decisions that improve their material well-being. As you have read, in a centrally planned economic system, the government decides what companies will be formed and how they will be run. In a free enterprise system, business owners and managers make such choices themselves based on what will increase their profits. Reliance on the profit motive has several benefits. It forces business owners to exercise financial discipline, because they are responsible for their own success or failure. It encourages entrepreneurs to take rational risks and rewards innovation by letting creative companies grow. It also improves productivity by allowing more efficient companies to make more money. As Figure 2.14 indicates, increasing productivity has been a consistent trend in the U.S. economy. Competition In order to make a profit, businesses must compete with one another for consumers&apos; money. When faced with several versions of the same product, all of similar quality, consumers will choose the product with the lowest price. If a business expects to compete successfully, it cannot simply raise prices to increase profits. It must set the prices of its products in response to what consumers are willing and able to pay for them. Competition, then, serves to regulate the free market by keeping prices from rising too high, and in this way it benefits consumers and producers by encouraging them to come together in the marketplace. Competition also encourages businesses to improve the quality of their products in order to attract consumers. The American economy also benefits from a tradition of open opportunity, the principle that anyone can compete in the marketplace.

At the same time, we believe that anyone who wants to start a business should have a chance. This allows economic mobility up or down: no matter how much money you start out with, you can end up wealthier or poorer depending on how your business performs. Legal Equality We also have a commitment to legal equality&ndash;the principle that everyone has the same legal rights. Legal equality benefits the economy by maximizing a country&apos;s use of its human capital. Countries that restrict the legal rights of women or minorities lose the productive potential of a large portion of their society. Private Property Rights In many ways, private property is the cornerstone of the free enterprise system. Private property rights give people the right to control their possessions and use them as they wish. The free enterprise system allows people to make their own decisions about the property they have purchased. Personal ownership provides an incentive for property owners to use property wisely and conserve resources. >> The Ford Motor Company had high hopes for the Edsel, a model introduced in 1957.

A singer can sign an agreement with any recording company. Consumers are free to choose to enter a credit card agreement with many banks. The right of voluntary exchange allows consumers and producers to decide what, when, and how they buy and sell. Voluntary exchange, in turn, encourages competition, which benefits consumers by providing a larger variety of goods at reasonable prices. Variety of goods and responsive prices, then, are key benefits of the free enterprise system. IdENTIfy Which basic characteristic of free enterprise ensures that consumers can choose from a variety of products at acceptable prices? Key Roles in the Free Enterprise System You have learned about the powerful dynamics that drive the free enterprise system. Now you will meet two key actors who fill critical roles and exert a strong influence on the economy. The Role of the Consumer A basic principle of the free enterprise system is that consumers have the freedom to make their own economic choices. Through voluntary exchange, consumers send a signal to businesses, telling them what and how much to produce. Consumers also send a signal when they do not buy a good or service. They are telling the producer that the good or service is not desirable or is priced too high. Consumers can also make their wishes known by joining an interest group, a private organization that tries to persuade public officials to act in ways that benefit its members. One consumer interest group is the Consumers Union, which works to persuade political leaders to pass laws to protect consumers. Businesses form interest groups as well. For instance, the National Retail Federation represents more than 10,000 firms. Interest groups have also formed around economic issues such as taxation, land use, and aid to farmers. The Role of the Entrepreneur Entrepreneurs, too, play a vital role in the free enterprise system.

Entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey are widely admired for their success and contributions to our economy and world. Like any business owner, the entrepreneur seeks to make a profit. Without the profit motive, entrepreneurs would have little incentive to face the challenge of creating and producing new goods and services. Entrepreneurs cannot be sure that consumers will want to buy their product. They know that starting a business is risky and that many new businesses fail. But they also know that successful entrepreneurs, those who correctly gauge consumer wants and needs, can make a large profit from their venture. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS What key roles do consumers and entrepreneurs play in the free enterprise system? Economic Freedom and the Constitution The economic freedoms that American consumers and producers enjoy are an important benefit of the U.S. free enterprise system and a source of patriotism, or love of one&apos;s country. In the free enterprise system, the right to own property or to become an entrepreneur is as basic to liberty as freedom of speech or the right to vote. According to a leading economist, these rights cannot be separated: Economic freedom plays a dual role in the promotion of a free society. On the one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is . . . an end in itself. In the second place, economic freedom is also an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom. &ndash; Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom Rights that allow people to engage in business activity are written into the framework of our nation, the Constitution.

The Fifth Amendment states that “no person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” The Fifth Amendment was originally applied only to the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, extended the same limitations to the state governments. These due process clauses prevent the government from taking property from its owner except when there is a public reason. For instance, when a state wants to add lanes to a highway, it may take land from people who own property along the route. This right of a government to take private property for public use is called eminent domain. Even then, the government must pay the person the fair value of the property that has been taken. This protection applies to businesses as well as to individuals. Taxation The Constitution also spells out how government can tax individuals and businesses. Congress has the power to tax only in the ways the Constitution allows. Article I gives Congress the power to levy taxes. However, Section 9 once required that direct taxes >> The role of government in protecting consumers includes regulations directing car companies to provide detailed information about the vehicles they sell. 54 TOPIC 2 Free Enterprise and Other Economic Systems be apportioned to states according to population. Thus, taxes collected from each state would be based on the number of people living in the state. This rule initially prevented Congress from passing an income tax, which would be a direct tax. The Sixteenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, first gave Congress the right to set direct taxes based on income. Under current law, both individuals and corporations must pay federal income tax. Contracts Finally, the Constitution guarantees people and businesses the right to make contracts, which are legally binding agreements between people or businesses. Article I, Section 10 prohibits the states from passing any “Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.” This means that individuals or businesses cannot use the political process to be excused from their contracts. No legislature can pass a law changing the terms of someone&apos;s business agreement. IdENTIfy SUPPORTING dETAILS What constitutional protections make it possible for Americans to conduct business in freedom? The Limited Role of Government in the Marketplace The government plays a limited but important part in the American free enterprise system. The government&apos;s primary role is to carry out its constitutional responsibilities to protect property rights, contracts, and other business activities. Over time, Americans have come to expect the government to take other actions to promote the public interest, or the concerns of society as a whole. The government has passed laws to protect us from economic problems that affect us all, such as pollution or unsafe foods and medicines. Information and Free Enterprise In a free market system, consumer buying decisions determine what goods get produced. But consumers cannot make informed choices if they do not have basic information about the products they are buying. In other words, educated consumers make the free market system work more efficiently. Because of this, one of the government&apos;s important roles in the economy is to make sure that producers provide consumers with information. ]]></text>

Determine Relevance How might the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau help protect the public? Bounce to Activate Timeline Toward this end, Congress has passed public disclosure laws, which require companies to give consumers important information about the products or services that they offer. Often this information is attached to the product when it is offered for sale. You may have seen energy efficiency tags on refrigerators, or heard car commercials in which the announcer reads off a long list of terms and conditions. Using this information, consumers can evaluate some important aspects of the products they are thinking about buying. Other laws require businesses to make the information they supply honest and clear. The Federal Trade Commission Act says that advertisements cannot be deceptive. The Truth-in- Lending Act requires businesses offering loans to disclose certain information to consumers before they sign a loan agreement. Consumers use this information to protect themselves from false claims. Protecting Public Health, Safety, and Well- Being Although the government does not get directly involved in running private businesses, it does place some limits on their actions in the public interest. For example, the federal government and many states are actively involved in passing laws aimed at protecting consumers. The government sets manufacturing standards, requires that drugs be safe and effective, and supervises the conditions in which foods are produced to make sure they are sanitary. Labels on consumer packages must include information about safe operation of equipment or expiration dates for perishables. A variety of federal and state agencies regulate industries whose goods and services affect the public interest. (See Figure 2.15.) For example, in response to growing public concern about the environment, the federal government formed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. Businesses must follow certain rules set by the EPA or by state agencies to protect the environment. Gas stations, for example, must dispose of used motor oil properly and ensure that gas tanks cannot leak into surrounding soil. Both individuals and businesses are subject to local zoning laws. Cities and towns often pass laws designating that certain areas can be used for residential or business purposes only. Zoning laws may forbid homeowners from establishing certain businesses out of their homes. They may block businesses from establishing or operating in certain neighborhoods. These are examples of how government places restrictions on the way businesses and individuals can use their property. 2.5 Benefits of Free Enterprise 55 ]]></text>

These placed limits on the establishment and operation of businesses, Government regulation, however, often has negative effects on businesses. Business owners pointed out that the rules were costly to implement, cutting into profits and slowing growth. Highly regulated industries, such as the airlines and telephone companies, said that government rules and regulations stifled competition, resulting in prices that were unnecessarily high. The growth in government oversight of industry also raised government spending, because the government had to hire workers to do the tasks involved in instituting and carrying out the new rules. In the 1980s and 1990s, public pressure for leaner, less costly government resulted in budget cuts that curtailed some government regulation of industry. Today, the government works to balance concerns raised by businesses with the need to protect the public. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS Why does the government place some limits on the freedom of businesses?

Even in our free enterprise system, government intervenes to influence macroeconomic trends. Macroeconomics is the study of economic behavior and decision-making in a nation&apos;s whole economy. By contrast, microeconomics is the study of economic behavior and decision-making in small units, such as households and firms. (The prefix macro means “large,” while micro means “small.”) GDP as a Measure of the Business Cycle One measure of a nation&apos;s economic health is gross domestic product (GDP), the total value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year. In a period of macroeconomic expansion, or growth, a country produces more than it did before, and GDP goes up. In a period of contraction, or decline, the country produces less, and GDP goes down. The alternating pattern of periodic expansion and contraction is called a business cycle. >> Objectives Explain why the government tracks and seeks to influence business cycles.

Each phase can last months or even years, as you can see in Figure 2.16. Forecasting the Business Cycle Changes in business cycles take place because individuals and businesses, acting in their own self-interest, make decisions about factors such as prices, production, and consumption. Business owners who think consumers are going to spend more in the future may increase production and hire more workers. If enough employers take these steps, the economy grows. On the other hand, concern about rising prices might lead consumers to buy fewer goods. If this decrease in consumer spending is widespread and lasts long enough, suppliers might be forced to cut production and to lay off workers. In Washington, D.C., government economists track where the country is in the business cycle and try to predict what will happen in the future. Public officials use this information to decide what actions to take, if any. Many businesses also make use of the government&apos;s economic data. The U.S. economy has changed dramatically through the country&apos;s history, and so has the role of government in the economy. Until the 1900s, the federal government collected relatively little The Business Cycle, 1930–2012 data about the nation&apos;s economy. During the Great Depression, the need for more comprehensive economic data became apparent. As a result, the government developed national accounting measures such as GDP. New agencies, such as the Council of Economic Advisers (established in 1946), began helping the president and Congress make better decisions about the economy. ChECK UNdERSTANdING Why do government experts track the business cycle? Encouraging Economic Strength Because the market is vulnerable to business cycles, the government tries to create public policies that promote economic strength. Again, the nature and extent of these policies have changed over the course of history. For example, in the 1800s, almost every decade brought a new financial crisis, but the federal government could do little to avert these catastrophes. As new agencies were created in the 1900s, the government gained more knowledge about the national economy and more tools to influence it.

Identify Central Issues How might levels of education, poverty, income inequality, and health impact standard of living? three main goals: high employment, growth, and stability&ndash;stable prices and secure financial institutions. Maximum Employment One aim of government economic policy is to ensure jobs for everyone who is able to work. In the United States, many economists consider an unemployment rate from 4 percent to 6 percent to be evidence of a healthy economy. If the unemployment rate rises higher than that, government officials may take various steps to encourage job growth. A Growing Economy Part of the American Dream has always been for each generation to enjoy a higher standard of living than previous generations. For that to happen, the economy must grow to provide additional goods and services. An increasing GDP is a sign of such growth. (See Figure 2.17 for more about GDP and the concept of standard of living.) To help growth, the government may cut taxes or increase spending. Experts often disagree as to which approach stimulates economic growth more effectively. Stability The government also seeks to keep the economy stable. Consumers, producers, and investors need to feel confident that economic conditions will not fluctuate unpredictably. If this confidence wavers, economic growth may slow or even stop. One indicator of economic stability is the general level of prices. A surge in prices puts a strain on consumers, especially people with low or fixed incomes. If prices sink, producers feel the pain. For example, a jump in milk prices hurts consumers, while a plunge in milk prices hurts farmers. Either way, the economy can suffer. The government thus seeks to prevent sudden, drastic shifts in prices. If it does so wisely, that sector of the economy remains stable, with little effect on consumers or producers. But if it errs, the government can interfere with that sector&apos;s economic health, making it difficult for producers to remain in business. Secure Financial Markets Another sign of economic stability is the security of financial institutions, such as banks or the stock market. Picture yourself going to the bank and finding it boarded up. When we make a deposit or a stock purchase, we want to know that our money will be protected from mismanagement or fraud and 2.6 Supporting Economic Growth 59 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="126"> <text><![CDATA[ shielded from the effects of sudden economic downturns. To provide such protections, the federal government monitors and regulates banks and other financial institutions. Some regulations protect bank deposits and retirees&apos; pensions. Federal regulators also investigate fraud and manage interest rates and the flow of money through the economy. Government intervention in the name of economic stability and security comes at a cost. In 2008, when the housing market collapsed, banks found themselves holding billions of dollars&apos; worth of loans borrowers could not repay. The banking system neared collapse, threatening the entire economy. The U.S. government stepped in to shore up the banks, loaning them billions of dollars and making other accommodations. The effort helped keep banks in business, but it was largely funded by U.S. taxpayers. There is a great deal of disagreement over the costs and benefits of this action. Economic Citizenship Economic policy is made by elected officials and the workers they appoint. But it is the voters who put these officials in office. On a state and local level, voters have an even more direct say. Ballots often include referendums, proposed laws submitted directly to the public, on spending or other economic issues. Voters, then, play a vital role in shaping government economic actions. As you can see in Figure 2.18, these actions have contributed to steady, strong growth in the United States over the past century. Like others in a market economy, voters make choices based on self-interest. To fully determine what policies best serve their interests, Americans must understand the macroeconomic processes that shape our futures. LIST What three goals does the government try to meet when promoting economic strength? Productivity and the Role of Technology The American economy supports a far higher standard of living than most economies of the world. As you have learned, one way to preserve that high standard is by increasing productivity&ndash;producing more outputs from the same or a smaller quantity of inputs. Technological Progress Improved technology is a key factor in boosting productivity. Technological progress has long enabled the economy of the United States to operate more efficiently, increasing GDP Real Gross Domestic Product, 1910–2012 14000 12000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 1910 1920 1930 1940 Real GDP (billions of dollars 2005) Year SOURCE: Louis Johnston and Samuel H.

Thomas Edison&apos;s invention of the light bulb made a longer workday possible. Henry Ford&apos;s use of the assembly line led to mass production of affordable cars. In recent times, computers have allowed workers to do more work in a shorter amount of time. Innovation often leads to obsolescence, as older products and processes become out-of-date. Workers, too, may be subject to obsolescence. One example is telephone operators who lost their jobs due to computerized dialing systems. Often, these physical and human resources can be used in other ways. Old industrial buildings can be converted into stores or apartments. Workers can be retrained to do other jobs. Encouraging Innovation To help maintain the country&apos;s technological advantage, the government promotes innovation and invention. Federal agencies fund scores of research and development projects at universities. The Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 created land-grant colleges that received federal land and money to pursue the study of “agriculture and the mechanical arts.” Land-grant schools from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Texas A&M University have been powerhouses of innovation. The government&apos;s own research institutions also produce a steady stream of new technologies. Probably the best-known of these federal institutions is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Technologies created by NASA, as part of the effort to send satellites and humans into space, have produced amazing spin- offs, or products with commercial uses. NASA spin- offs range from a muscle stimulator for people with paralysis to a scanner that allows firefighters to see “invisible flames” given off by alcohol or hydrogen fires. The government also encourages innovation by granting patents and copyrights. A patent gives the inventor of a new product the exclusive right to produce and sell it for 20 years. A copyright grants an author exclusive rights to publish and sell his or her creative works. Patents and copyrights are an incentive to innovation because they protect people&apos;s right to profit from their creativity in the free market. The American Work Ethic While government incentives may encourage innovation, economic growth cannot occur without individual effort. When asked to account for his success in the movie and recording industries, Will Smith stated: I&apos;ve never really viewed myself as particularly talented. I&apos;ve viewed myself as slightly above average in talent. And where I excel is ridiculous, sickening worth ethic. You know, while the other guy&apos;s sleeping? I&apos;m working. While the other guy&apos;s eating? I&apos;m working. &ndash;Will Smith, 60 Minutes interview The work ethic Smith refers to is a commitment to the value of hard work. It not only means working hard, but also caring about the quality of one&apos;s work. The American work ethic has long been seen as a key ingredient in the nation&apos;s productivity and economic success. ExPRESS IdEAS CLEARLy How does improved technology help the economy?

For example, the job of building a bridge would become almost impossible if it had to be done by the joint action of all the people and businesses that would benefit from it. Sometimes, the government has to step in. Roads and bridges are two of the many examples of public goods the government provides. A public good is a shared good or service for which it would be inefficient or impractical (1) to make consumers pay individually and (2) to exclude those who did not pay. What Makes a Public Good Let us look at the first feature of a public good, the inefficiency or impracticality of making each consumer pay for the good individually. How would you like to receive a bill for your share of launching a space shuttle, cleaning Mount Rushmore, or paying the salary of every soldier in the army? To simplify the funding of government projects in the public interest, the government collects taxes.

    <page pageNumber="129"> <text><![CDATA[ What about the second feature of a public good, the inefficiency or impracticality of excluding nonpayers from using the good? Imagine the arguments and traffic delays that would erupt if drivers who refused to pay to use a street were told they had to turn around and drive away. Also, as a society, we believe that certain facilities or services, such as libraries or protection from fire, should be available to all, rich or poor. In the case of most public goods, it is simply not practical for a private business to provide the good or service, charge those who benefit, and exclude nonpayers from using it. Neither is it efficient. Take, for example, national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite. These are unique national treasures. If these parks were privately owned, the owner could charge an excessively high admission fee. Also, no other producer could produce a Yellowstone or Yosemite. Thus private ownership would be inefficient, because resources could not be used in a way that would maximize output. Public goods have another characteristic. Any number of consumers can use them without reducing the benefits to any single consumer. For the most part, increasing the number of consumers does not increase the cost of providing the public good. So, if you are driving on a highway and eight other drivers enter it, they do not significantly reduce the road&apos;s benefits to you or increase the government&apos;s cost of providing the road. Public goods are financed by the public sector, the part of the economy that involves the transactions of the government. The private sector, the part of the economy that involves transactions of individuals and businesses, would have little incentive to produce public goods. Weighing Costs and Benefits As you have read, governments step in to act in the public interest when they determine that the benefits of a policy outweigh the drawbacks, or the costs. In road construction, the benefits are obvious. Transportation is a vital part of the nation&apos;s infrastructure, the basic facilities that are necessary for a society and economy to function efficiently and grow. American leaders have long regarded investment in infrastructure not only as a means to provide needed public goods, but also as a way to promote economic growth: Investing in infrastructure not only makes our roads, bridges, and ports safer and allows our businesses and workers to be as competitive as they need to be in the global economy, it also creates thousands of good American jobs that cannot be outsourced. &ndash;White House Press Release, February 20, 2013 Transportation improves when governments build needed roads. An economist might say that the government&apos;s policy of providing this public good also benefits the economy by increasing efficiency. That is, government investment in road-building uses resources in a way that maximizes the output of roads. The drawback, though, is the economic freedom we give up. None of us individually gets to decide what roads will be built or where. In this case, the advantages clearly outweigh the drawback. In other cases, weighing benefits against costs is more complex. As Figure 2.19 shows, understanding the costs and benefits is critical in determining whether something gets produced as a public good. Two cost- benefit criteria must be present. 1. The benefit to each individual is less than the cost that each would have to pay if it were provided privately. >> This bridge is a public good. It benefits society by encouraging commercial and personal links between two populated areas otherwise kept apart by a river. 2.7 Public Goods and Externalities 63 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="130"> <text><![CDATA[ 2. The total benefits to society are greater than the total cost. If just one or a few people got together to fund the project, the cost to each of them would be much higher than the benefits each would gain&ndash;whether in the form of profits or some other reward or advantage. In such circumstances, the market would not provide the good. But if you look at society as a whole, the picture changes. As long as the benefit all people gain exceeds the total cost, it makes sense for government to fund the project. From the individual&apos;s point of view, this situation is better too. The government can fund the project by collecting a small amount of money in taxes from a large number of people. That means the share paid by each person is much less than it would be if they had to fund the project alone or even through a small group. In economic terms, the need for government to provide public goods is a matter of efficiency, of maximizing the output of goods and services. In the case of public goods, the market cannot be counted on to maximize the output. Private firms have no way of forcing each person who “consumes” the light from a streetlight, for example, to pay for it. For this reason, they cannot produce as many streetlights as consumers need. It would be inefficient to do so. The government, however, can produce streetlights and other public goods efficiently. Through taxes, it can take in enough revenue to produce the needed amount of streetlights. This does not mean, however, that government will choose to spend its tax revenue on streetlights&ndash; or on roads or bridges or public parks. Decisions about how the government uses tax dollars depend on its economic policies. The costs and benefits of any proposed policy must be analyzed to be sure that they fulfill the economic goal of efficiency. The benefits must exceed the costs. Free-Rider Problem A phenomenon associated with public goods is called the “free-rider problem.” A free rider is someone who would not be willing to pay for a certain good or service, but would get the benefit of it anyway if it were provided as a public good. Unlike consumers in the free marketplace, free riders consume what they do not directly pay for. You probably would not voluntarily contribute to build roads in a state you did not live in. Yet when states tax their citizens to build and maintain roads, you share in the benefit. For example, the roads in other states make it easier for trucking companies to bring goods to your state.

Try another example: Everyone on your street wants fire protection except one penny-pinching neighbor, who says it is not worth the money. Don&apos;t you want him to have fire protection anyway? If his house catches fire, yours could ignite as well. So local taxes pay for firefighting services for all property in an area, because all residents are better off if the government provides this service. Your free-rider neighbor benefits from this service as well. The free-rider problem suggests what would happen if the government stopped collecting taxes to fund public services. If it relied on voluntary contributions instead, many people would refuse to give money. Yet they would still use the services. Many public services would then have to be eliminated. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS What two cost-benefit criteria must be met for something to be produced as a public good? Market Failures Public goods are examples of what some economists call a market failure. The term does not suggest that the free enterprise system does not work. Rather, market failure describes a specific situation in which the free market, operating on its own, does not distribute resources efficiently. To understand market failure, recall how a successful free market operates: Choices made by individuals determine what goods get made, how they get made, and who consumes the goods. Profit incentives attract producers who, because of competition, provide goods and services that consumers need at prices that are reasonable and responsive to market forces. In the road-building scenario, are these features present? Generally not. If a company were to build a road, there would be no real competition. So, the company could charge a high price for tolls for those wishing to use the road. Also, companies would not choose to build roads in sparsely populated areas because there would be little incentive to do so. They would see no chance to earn profits&ndash;a low population would mean too few drivers to charge. >> In the 1930s, utilities had no incentive to string electric lines to isolated areas. Government took on that task with the Rural Electrification Administration. Infer Why do you think the government was willing to help bring electricity to rural areas? As a result, the criteria for a properly functioning market system do not exist. For that reason, the road- building scenario is a market failure. ChECK UNdERSTANdING In what way are public goods examples of market failure? Externalities Out-of-state drivers can travel over roads that they did not pay to have built. Nonpayers as well as payers enjoy the environmental benefits of national parks. Both of these examples involve what economists call externalities. An externality is an economic side effect of a good or service that generates benefits or costs to someone other than the person deciding how much to produce or consume. Externalities may be either positive or negative. Positive Externalities As you have read, public goods generate benefits to many people, not just those who pay for the goods. Such beneficial side effects are positive externalities. Some of the 2.7 Public Goods and Externalities 65 ]]></text>

The private sector&ndash;both individuals and businesses&ndash;can create positive externalities, too. For instance: &bull; Walsh Computers hires underprivileged teenagers and trains them to be computer programmers. Walsh set up this training program to serve its own interests. However, the newly trained workers can be hired by other companies, who benefit from the workers&apos; skills without having paid for them. The state and federal government may also benefit from this externality by receiving higher income taxes from the trained workers. &bull; Mrs. Ruiz buys an old house that is an eyesore in the neighborhood. She paints the house, cuts the grass, and plants flowers. Her neighbors were not involved in her decision, nor did they share the cost. Yet they receive benefits from it, such as higher property values and a better view. The higher property values may also benefit the local government through higher property tax receipts. &bull; Positive externalities may also have an impact on the environment at the local, state, and national level. For example, when a company enacts a policy to reduce its waste or carbon emissions, it helps improve the environment. This in turn can help the local, state, and national economies. In fact, many economists believe that the private sector generates positive externalities more efficiently than the public sector can, and at less cost to taxpayers. Whether private or public, positive externalities allow someone who did not purchase a good to enjoy part of the benefits of that good. In the 1990s, several endangered species, including the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon, were saved from extinction. Protection of species critical to our ecosystem benefits us all. Negative Externalities Of course, as Figure 2.20 shows, producing goods and services can also generate unintended costs, called negative externalities. Negative externalities cause part of the cost of producing a good or service to be paid for by someone other than the producer. For example: &bull; The Enchanted Forest Paper Mill releases chemical wastes into a nearby river, making it unhealthy. The city of Tidyville, downstream from the mill, is forced to install special equipment at its water-treatment plant to clean up the chemicals. The THE NEW CAPP COUNTY BRIDGE Negative Externalities &bull; Construction and increased traffic lower air quality in area. &bull; River environment is altered, harming local fishery. &bull; Bridge drives ferry company out of business.

This negative externality costs the local government money and hurts the local environment and economy. Negative externalities from pollution can have a harmful impact on the environment and economy at the state and national level as well. &bull; Your next-door neighbor, Mr. Fogler, takes up the accordion and holds Friday night polka parties in his backyard. Unfortunately, you hate polka music. Government&apos;s Goals Externalities are a sign of market failure because the costs or benefits of a good or service are not assigned properly. Understanding externalities helps us see another role that the government plays in the American economy. First, the government may take action to create positive externalities. Education, for example, benefits students directly. Yet society as a whole also benefits from an educated population, because educated workers are generally more productive. Second, the government aims to limit negative externalities, such as pollution. Pollutants from coal- burning power plants and auto emissions can drift high into the atmosphere and come down in the form of acid rain, which causes ecological damage. Why is acid rain a negative externality? It is part of the cost of producing power and driving cars, but that cost is imposed upon people other than those who produce the pollution. The cost is damaged trees, lakes, and wildlife. To address this negative externality, the federal government now requires new cars to have an expensive antipollution device called a catalytic converter. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency offers incentives to power-plant operators to put “scrubbers” on their smokestacks to cut emissions. These actions transfer the costs of pollution back to its producers. Government management of this negative externality has yielded positive results. For example, emissions of sulfur dioxide, a key trigger of acid rain, decreased by 64 percent between 1990 and 2009. Government-Driven or Market-Driven Solutions? As you saw, many economists think that the private sector can better reduce negative externalities than the government can. This belief has spurred debate over how to stop damage to the environment. Since the 1970s, the government has often tried to halt pollution by creating strict regulations. Many >> The government takes steps to limit negative externalities. This costly pollution-control equipment is a response to government rules put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency. economists say that this approach is inefficient and limits growth, because it increases costs. It also ties the hands of businesses by requiring specific solutions rather than encouraging innovation. These economists want the government to allow market-driven solutions to environmental problems. In this approach, the government would still play a role by setting standards that industries would have to meet. Individual firms, though, would have more freedom to find ways to meet those goals. IdENTIfy SUPPORTING dETAILS What does the government do in response to negative externalities? The Poverty Problem You&apos;ve seen it all around you: on TV shows, in the news, maybe even in your community. There are vast differences between people who have a lot of money, enough money, and very little money. On the average, Americans enjoy a high standard of living. Yet about 15 percent of Americans live in poverty. And for people under the age of 18, the percentage is even higher. 2.7 Public Goods and Externalities 67 ]]></text>

Analyze Political Cartoons Who do you think the person in this cartoon represents, and what is his reaction to the sign on the door? To help the poor, government programs take money from some people and redistribute it to others. Yet critics say such actions violate the economic principle of limited government intervention. While the free market has proven better than any other economic system at generating wealth, that wealth is spread unevenly throughout society. This leaves some people below the poverty threshold, an income level below that which is needed to support families. The poverty threshold is determined by the federal government and adjusted periodically. In 2012, the poverty threshold for a single parent under age 65 with one child under age 18 was $15,825 per year. For a four-person family with two children, it was $23,283 per year. The U.S. Bureau of the Census, part of the Department of Labor, establishes the poverty threshold for families of different sizes and ages. Each year, the poverty threshold is adjusted based on the cost of the goods a family needs to buy. As prices rise, so does the poverty threshold. The Government&apos;s Role As a society, we recognize some responsibilities to the very young, the very old, the sick, the poor, and the disabled. The society tries to provide a safety net for people in these groups, in the form of federal, state, and local government programs. These programs aim to raise people&apos;s standard of living, or their level of economic well-being as measured by the ability to purchase goods and services they need and want. The Welfare System Since the 1930s, the main government effort to ease poverty has been to collect taxes from individuals and redistribute some of those funds in the form of welfare. Welfare is a general term for government aid for the poor. It includes many types of programs that redistribute wealth from some people to others. The nation&apos;s welfare system began under President Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression. Welfare spending greatly increased in the 1960s under President Lyndon Johnson&apos;s “War on Poverty.” Federal welfare programs came under increasing attack in the 1980s. Critics voiced concern about people becoming dependent on welfare and unable or unwilling to get off it. Some critics also claimed that income redistribution discourages productivity, thus actually aggravating poverty. In 1996, Congress made sweeping changes to the welfare system. New reforms limited the amount of time people could receive welfare and gave states more freedom to experiment with antipoverty programs. RECALL What is the goal of government welfare programs?

Lesson 1: The Three Key Economic Questions LAFS.1112.WHST.3.9, SS.912.E.1.3, SS.912.E.2.1 Every society has to answer three basic economic questions: What goods and services should be produced? How should they be produced? Who consumes them? Their answers depend on the importance they attach to different economic goals. Answers to these questions also differ among the four main economic systems. Lesson 2: Free Markets LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.3, SS.912.E.1.8 Free market economies rely on interaction in free markets to answer the three basic economic questions. Free market economies are based on private ownership of property and free exchange markets. Competition and self-interest keep markets fair and responsive to people&apos;s needs and priorities. Free market economies have many advantages. Lesson 3: Centrally Planned Economies LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.3 In centrally planned economies governments, rather than individual consumers and producers, make decisions that answer the three basic economic questions. Socialist economies allow for democracy and market structures alongside an economic role for government, but communist economies involve complete government control and authoritarian governments that limit freedom. Lesson 4: Mixed Economies SS.912.E.1.3, SS.912.E.2.12 Most economies today are mixed economies. These feature free markets alongside some government involvement. Governments buy and sell goods on the market. They also collect taxes, deliver transfer payments to individuals or businesses in need of help, and provide government services. The United States is one example of a mixed economy. It offers a high degree of economic freedom. Lesson 5: Benefits of Free Enterprise LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 The American free enterprise system offers opportunity, competition, legal equality, constitutionally protected private property rights, economic freedom, and incentives such as the profit motive. Entrepreneurs and consumers interact through the market to ensure that needs are met. Government may intervene in the economy to promote the public interest. Lesson 6: Supporting Economic Growth LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 In the United States, government programs aim to support economic growth, which can be measured through the gross domestic product. Government programs aim to boost employment, growth, secure financial markets, and innovation. Voters shape government action. Lesson 7: Public Goods and Externalities LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.2.11 Governments must provide government goods&ndash;or goods that can&apos;t be distributed effectively through markets&ndash;including infrastructure such as highways. Public goods often respond to market failures, in which the market fails to distribute resources efficiently. Market failures may involve externalities. Governments also operate programs that aim to relieve poverty. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="139"> <text><![CDATA[ DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTIONS LAFS.1112.RH.3.8, SS.912.E.1.3 Communists argued that central planning was necessary for their economies, but their critics argued that it was fatally flawed. Study the documents below, then answer the questions that follow. DOCUMENT A To rebuild the economy after the destruction of the Russian Revolution, Communist Leon Trotsky argued that central planning was needed. The widest possible application of the principle of general labor service . . . can play a decisive part only in case they are applied on the basis of a single economic plan covering the whole country and all branches of productive activity. This plan must be drawn up for a number of years, for the whole epoch that lies before us. It is naturally broken up into separate periods or stages, corresponding to the inevitable stages in the economic rebirth of the country. . . . After we have conquered our terrible misery, have accumulated small supplies of raw material and food, and have improved our transport, we shall be able to leap over a whole series of intermediate stages, benefiting by the fact that we are not bound by the chains of private property, and that therefore we are able to subordinate all [enterprises] and all the elements of economic life to a single State plan. &ndash;Leon Trotsky, Dictatorship vs. Democracy, 1920 DOCUMENT B Central planning in the Soviet Union often left shelves bare of the goods consumers wanted, as this photograph from 1990 shows. DOCUMENT C Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian economist, predicted that central planning would lead to economic failure. The more communal [government-run] enterprise extends, the more attention is drawn to the bad business results of [government-run enterprises]. . . . It has not been realized that even exceptionally gifted men of high character cannot solve the problems created by socialist control of industry. . . . We can see this best if we think of the picture of the entrepreneur which is generally drawn by socialists. . . . Socialism, including Marxian Socialism, sees in the entrepreneur someone alien to the process of production . . . [Socialists believe that i]t will be sufficient to expropriate [take the possessions of] these parasites to bring about a socialist society. . . . But the entrepreneur fulfills a task which must be performed even in a socialist community. This the Socialist does not see; or at least refuses to see. &ndash; Ludwig von Mises, Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis, 1922 22. Which of the following is a premise, or assumption, made by Trotsky that conflicts with what you have learned in the text? A. Labor plays an important role in economic development. B. Investment in transport can boost economic growth. C. Government action can allocate resources efficiently. D. Private property encourages economic growth. 23. Analyze Photographs What does the photograph suggest about the other two sources? 24. Why does Mises argue that “even exceptionally gifted men of high character” cannot solve the problems caused by planned economies? A. because planned economies are too complicated for anyone to understand B. because planned economies are structurally flawed and cannot deliver good results C. because planned economies are controlled by people more interested in power than good results D. because gifted men of high character cannot be as ruthless as entrepreneurs 25. Writing Task Evaluate the premises, claims, and evidence in the excerpts from Trotsky and Mises by comparing and contrasting them with the information in the text and in Document B. Which author is better supported by the information? Provide at least two pieces of evidence supporting that author. ]]></text>

The Law of Demand Demand is the desire to own something and the ability to pay for it. To have demand for a good or service, both of these conditions must be present. We will look at the demand side of markets over the next three lessons. Later, we will look at the actions of sellers, which economists call the supply side. Then, we will look at supply and demand together and study how they interact to establish the prices that we pay for most goods. Anyone who has ever spent money will easily understand the law of demand. The law of demand says that when a good&apos;s price is lower, the quantity demanded, or the amount people are willing to buy, is greater. When the price is higher, the quantity demanded is lower.

    <page pageNumber="145"> <text><![CDATA[ $10 million, the price of a good will strongly influence your decision to buy. David Henderson, an economics professor who served as a senior economist with the President&apos;s Council of Economic Advisers, describes the importance of the law of demand: The most famous law in economics, and the one that economists are most sure of, is the law of demand. On this law is built almost the whole edifice of economics. &ndash;David Henderson, “Demand,” The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics Now ask yourself a question: Would you buy a slice of pizza for lunch if it cost $2? Many of us would, and some of us might even buy more than one slice. But would you buy the same slice of pizza if it cost $4? Fewer of us would buy it at that price. Even real pizza lovers might reduce their consumption from three or four slices to just one or two. How many of us would buy a slice for $20? Probably very few would pay that amount. As the price of pizza gets higher and higher, fewer of us are willing to buy it. That is the law of demand in action. The law of demand is the result of not just one pattern of behavior, but two separate patterns that overlap. These two behavior patterns are the substitution effect and the income effect. The substitution effect and the income effect describe two different ways that a consumer can change his or her spending patterns. Together, they explain why an increase in price decreases the amount purchased. The Substitution Effect When the price of a burrito rises, burritos become more expensive compared with other foods such as salads or tacos. So, as the price of a burrito rises, consumers have an incentive to buy one of those alternatives as a substitute for burritos. This causes a drop in the number of burritos demanded. For example, instead of eating burritos for lunch on Mondays and Fridays, a student could eat a burrito on Mondays and a bagel on Fridays. This change in consumption is known as the substitution effect. The substitution effect takes place when a consumer reacts to a rise in the price of one good by consuming less of that good and more of a substitute good. The substitution effect can also apply to a drop in prices. If the price of a brand of athletic shoes drops, those shoes become cheaper compared to other brands or types of shoes.

The Income Effect Rising prices have another effect that we have all felt. They make us feel poorer. When the price of movie tickets, shoes, or pizza increases, your limited budget just won&apos;t buy as much as it did in the past. It feels as if you have less money. You can no longer afford to buy the same combination of goods, and you must cut back your purchases of some goods. If you buy fewer slices of pizza without increasing your purchases of other foods, that is the income effect. One important fact to remember is that economists measure consumption in the amount of a good that is bought, not the amount of money spent to buy it. Although you are spending more on pizza, you are consuming fewer slices, so your consumption has gone down. If the price rises from $2 a slice to $4 a slice, you may decide to pay extra and order your usual lunch, but you certainly would not choose to buy more slices than before. When the price goes up, consumers spend more of their money on pizza, but they may demand less of it. Thus, the income effect has led to a decrease in the quantity demanded. Remember, too, that the income effect also operates when the price is lowered. If the price of pizza falls, you suddenly feel wealthier. If you buy The Law of Demand in Action more pizza as a result of the lower price, that&apos;s the income effect. IdENTIfy If you buy less clothing because the price of clothing at your favorite store has gone up, what has happened? The Demand Schedule The law of demand, along with concepts such as the substitution effect and income effect, explains how the price of any item affects the quantity demanded of that item. Before we look at the relationship between price and the quantity demanded for a specific good, we need to look more closely at how economists use the word demand. Understanding Demand To have demand for a good, you must be willing and able to buy it at the specified price. In other words, demand means that you want the good and can afford to buy it. You may desperately want a new car, a laptop computer, or a trip to Alaska, but if you can&apos;t truly afford any of these goods, then you do not demand them. You might demand digital music downloads, though, if you want to buy some and have enough money to do so at the current price. A demand schedule is a table that lists the quantity of a good that a person will purchase at various prices in a market.

When you add up the demand schedules of every buyer in the market, you can create a market demand schedule. A market demand schedule shows the quantities demanded at various prices by all consumers in the market. A market demand schedule for pizza would allow a restaurant owner to predict the total sales of pizza at several different prices. The owner of a pizzeria could create a market demand schedule for pizza slices by surveying his or her customers and then adding up the quantities demanded by all individual consumers at each price. The resulting market demand schedule will look like Ashley&apos;s demand schedule, but the quantities will be larger, as shown in Figure 3.1. Note that the market demand schedule on the right in Figure 3.1 contains the same prices as Ashley&apos;s individual demand schedule, since those are the possible prices that may be charged by the pizzeria. The schedule also exhibits the law of demand. At higher prices, the quantity demanded is lower. The only difference between the two demand schedules is that the market schedule lists larger quantities demanded because the market demand schedule reflects the purchase decisions of all potential consumers in the market. IdENTIfy CENTRAL ISSUES In order for demand for a good to be present, what two conditions must be present? The Demand Graph What if you took the numbers in Ashley&apos;s demand schedule in Figure 3.1 and plotted them on a graph? The result would be a demand graph, or curve. A demand curve is a graphic representation of a demand schedule. How do economists create a demand curve? When they transfer numbers from a demand schedule to a graph, they always label the vertical axis with the lowest possible prices at the bottom and the highest price at the top. Likewise, they always label the quantities demanded on the horizontal axis with the lowest possible quantity at the left and the highest possible quantity at the right. All demand graphs show that each pair of price and quantity-demanded numbers on the demand schedule is plotted as a point on the graph. Connecting the points on the graph creates a demand curve. 3.1 Fundamentals of Demand 81 ]]></text>

Analyze Graphs How much pizza does Ashley demand at $5 a slice? Bounce to Activate Chart Reading a Demand Curve Note two facts about Ashley&apos;s demand curve shown in Figure 3.2. First, the graph shows only the relationship between the price of this good and the quantity that Ashley will purchase. It assumes that all other factors that would affect her demand for pizza&ndash;like her income, and the quality of the pizza&ndash;are held constant. Second, the demand curve on the graph slopes downward to the right. If you follow the curve from the top left to the bottom right, you will notice that as price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. Demand schedules and curves reflect the law of demand, which states that higher prices will always lead to lower quantities demanded. Ashley&apos;s demand curve in Figure 3.2 shows her demand for slices of pizza. The market demand curve in Figure 3.2 shows the quantities demanded by all consumers at the same prices. Thus, the prices listed on the vertical axis are identical to those in Ashley&apos;s demand curve. The quantities listed on the horizontal axis are much larger, corresponding to those in the market demand schedule in Figure 3.2. Limits of a Demand Curve The market demand curve in Figure 3.2 can predict how people will change their buying habits when the price of a good rises or falls. For example, if the price of pizza is $3 a slice, the pizzeria will sell 200 slices a day. This market demand curve is only accurate for one very specific set of market conditions. It cannot predict changing market conditions. Next, you will learn how demand curves can shift because of changes in factors other than price. dEfINE What is a market demand curve? ASSESSMENT 1.

On a stormy night, the Burger Barn may be nearly empty while the phone is ringing off the hook at the Pizza Palace with orders for delivery. Ceteris Paribus When we counted the number of pizza slices that would sell as the price went up or down, we assumed that nothing besides the price of pizza would change. Economists refer to this assumption as ceteris paribus, the Latin phrase for “all other things held constant.” The demand schedule took into account only changes in price. It did not consider the effects of news reports or any one of thousands of other factors that change from day to day. A demand curve is accurate only as long as there are no changes other than price that could affect the consumer&apos;s decision. In other words, a demand curve is accurate only as long as the ceteris paribus assumption is true. When the price changes, we move along the curve to a different quantity demanded. For example, in Figure 3.2, you saw that an increase in price from $2 to $3 per slice will make Ashley&apos;s quantity of pizza demanded fall from four slices to three slices per day. This movement along the demand curve is referred to as a decrease SS.912.E.1.4, LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 NGSSS >> Objectives Explain the difference between a change in quantity demanded and a shift in the demand curve.

Demand Shifts When we drop the ceteris paribus rule and allow other factors to change, we no longer move along the demand curve. Instead, the entire demand curve shifts. A shift in the demand curve means that at every price, consumers buy a different quantity than before. This shift of the entire curve is what economists refer to as a change in demand. Suppose, for example, that Ashley&apos;s town is hit by a heat wave, and Ashley no longer feels as hungry for hot pizza. She will demand fewer slices at every price. The graph on the left in Figure 3.3 shows her original demand curve and her new demand curve, adjusted for hot weather. ExPLAIN What does a shift in the demand curve indicate about demand for a particular good? The Non-Price Determinants of Demand As you have read, a change in the price of a good will change demand. But it does not cause the demand curve to shift. The effects of changes in price are built into the demand curve. However, several factors can cause demand for a good to change. These are called non- price determinants. They are factors that can lead to the shifting of demand up or down. Non- price determinants include income, consumer expectations, population, demographics, and consumer tastes and advertising. Changes in Income A consumer&apos;s income affects his or her demand for most goods. Most items that we purchase are normal goods, goods that consumers demand more of when their incomes increase. In other words, an increase in Ashley&apos;s income from $50 per week to $75 per week will cause her to buy more of a normal good at every price level. If we were to draw a new demand schedule for Ashley, it would show a greater demand for slices of pizza at every price. Plotting the new schedule on a graph would produce a curve to the right of Ashley&apos;s original curve. For each of the prices on the vertical axis, the quantity demanded would be greater. This shift to the right of the curve is called an increase in demand. A fall in income would cause the demand curve to shift to the left. This shift is called a decrease in demand. There are also other goods called inferior goods. They are called inferior goods because an increase in income causes demand for these goods to fall.

GalleryBounce to Activate Gallery in smaller quantities, or not at all, if your income were to rise and you could afford something better. Possible examples of inferior goods include macaroni and cheese, generic cereals, and used cars. Consumer Expectations Our expectations about the future can affect our demand for certain goods today. Suppose that you have had your eye on a new bicycle for several months. One day you walk into the store to look at the bike, and the salesperson mentions that the store will be raising the price in one week. Now that you expect a higher price in the near future, you are more likely to buy the bike today. In other words, the expectation of a higher price in the future has caused your immediate demand to increase. If, on the other hand, the salesperson were to tell you that the bike will be on sale next week, your immediate demand for the bicycle would fall to zero. Or perhaps you live in a state that has a so-called tax holiday coming up. You would rather wait to buy the bike when its price to you is lower. The current demand for a good is positively related to its expected future price. If you expect the price to rise, your current demand will rise, which means you will buy the good sooner. If you expect the price to drop, your current demand will fall, and you will wait for the lower price. Changes in Demographics Demographics are the statistical characteristics of populations, such as age, race, gender, occupation, and income level. Businesses use this data to identify who potential customers are, where they live, and how likely they are to purchase a specific product. Demographics also have a strong influence on the packaging, pricing, and advertising for a product. Growing ethnic groups, like Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans, can create shifts in demand for goods and services. In the United States, Hispanic Americans accounted for about one half of the national population growth between 2000 and 2011. Analysts predict that by 2050, Hispanic Americans will make up 29 percent of the U.S. population. Such demographic changes have profound implications for the marketplace. As the purchasing power of Hispanic Americans grows, firms will devote more of their resources to producing goods and services demanded by these consumers. Changes in Population Size Changes in the size of the population will also affect the demand for most products. For example, a growing population needs to be housed and fed. Therefore, a rise in population will increase demand for houses, food, and many other goods and services. 3.2 Shifts in Demand 85 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="152"> <text><![CDATA[ Population trends can have a strong effect on certain goods. For example, when American soldiers returned from World War II in the mid- to late 1940s, record numbers of them married and started families. This trend led to the “baby boom,” a jump in the birthrate from 1946 through 1964. Initially, the boom led to higher demand for baby clothes, baby food, and books on baby care. In the 1950s and 1960s, towns built thousands of new schools. Later, universities expanded and opened new campuses to make room for new students. The baby boomers have now begun to retire. Over the next few decades, the market will face rising demand for the goods and services that are desired by senior citizens, including medical care, recreational vehicles, and homes in the Sunbelt. Consumer Tastes and Advertising Who can explain why bell-bottom blue jeans were everywhere one year and rarely seen the next? Is it the result of clever advertising campaigns, social trends, the influence of television shows, or some combination of these factors? Although economists cannot always explain why some fads begin, advertising and publicity often play an important role. Changes in tastes and preferences cannot be explained by changes in income or population or worries about future price increases. Advertising is a factor that shifts demand curves because it plays Growing Power of Social Media an important role in many trends. Meanwhile, new media and new technology have led to new trends in advertising. Although broadcast television is still the biggest advertising medium, viewers can now watch television programs on the Internet, cellphones, or DVD players. Digital media make it easier for consumers to avoid advertisements. Marketers who want to reach these new media consumers are changing their traditional advertising strategies. Spending for online ads continues to grow. Video is the fastest-growing Internet ad format, topped only by search engine advertising. Ad spending on social network Web sites such as Facebook was estimated at $6.1 billion in 2013. The popularity of social network Web sites has inspired companies to build their own sites. The goal is to connect with consumers on a personal level while promoting their products and brand names. Companies spend money on advertising because they hope that it will increase the demand for the goods they sell. Considering the growing sums of money spent on advertising in the United States each year, companies must believe that this investment is paying off.

There are two types of related goods that interact this way: complements and substitutes. &bull; Complements are two goods that are bought and used together. &bull; Substitutes are goods that are used in place of one another. When we consider the demand for skis, ski boots are considered a complement. An increase in the price of ski boots will cause people to buy fewer boots. Because skis are useless without boots, the demand for skis will fall at all prices&ndash;after all, why buy new skis if you can&apos;t afford the ski boots you need? Now consider the effect on the demand for skis when the price of snowboards rises. Snowboards are a substitute for skis, because consumers will often buy one or the other but not both. A rise in the price of snowboards will cause people to buy fewer snowboards, and, therefore, people will buy more pairs of skis at every price. Likewise, a fall in the price of snowboards will lead consumers to buy fewer skis at all price levels. APPLy CONCEPTS How do non-price determinants affect demand? ASSESSMENT 1.

Several factors&ndash; including the original price and how much you want or need a particular good&ndash; will determine your demand for that product. The Concept of Elasticity Economists describe the way that consumers respond to price changes as elasticity of demand. Elasticity of demand measures how drastically buyers will cut back or increase their demand for a good when the price rises or falls, respectively. If you buy the same amount or just a little less of a good after a large price increase, your demand is inelastic, or relatively unresponsive to price changes. If you buy much less of a good after a small price increase, your demand is elastic. A consumer with highly elastic demand for a good is very responsive to price changes&ndash;both increases and decreases. How Elasticity Is Calculated In order to calculate elasticity of demand, take the percentage change in the quantity of the good demanded, and divide this number by the percentage change in the price of the good. The result is the elasticity of demand for the good. VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="155"> <text><![CDATA[ The law of demand implies that the result will always be negative. That is because an increase in the price of a good will always decrease the quantity demanded, and a decrease in the price of a good will always increase the quantity demanded. For the sake of simplicity, economists drop the negative sign in the result. You can find the equation for elasticity in Figure 3.4. Price Range The elasticity of demand for a good varies at every price level. Demand for a good can be highly elastic at one price and inelastic at a different price. For example, demand for a glossy magazine will be inelastic when the price rises 50 percent, from $1 to $1.50. The new price is still low, and people will buy almost as many copies as they did before. However, when the price of a magazine increases 50 percent, from $4 to $6, demand will be much more elastic. Many readers will refuse to pay $2 more for the magazine. Yet in percentage terms, the change in the magazine&apos;s price is exactly the same as when the price rose from $1 to$1.50. Elasticity Values We have been using the terms inelastic and elastic to describe consumers&apos; responses to price changes&ndash;including increases and decreases. These terms have precise mathematical definitions. Figure 3.5 shows how the demand curves for elastic and inelastic demand look&ndash;in this case, when prices drop. If the elasticity of demand for a good at a certain price is less than 1, we describe demand as inelastic. If the elasticity is greater than 1, demand is elastic. If elasticity is exactly equal to 1, we describe demand as unitary elastic. When elasticity of demand is unitary, the percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in the price. Suppose the elasticity of demand for a magazine at $2 is unitary. When the price of the magazine rises by 50 percent to $3, the newsstand will sell exactly half as many copies as before. Recall Figure 3.1, which includes an individual demand schedule&ndash;Ashley&apos;s demand for pizza. This demand schedule shows that if the price per slice were to rise from $2 to $3, Ashley&apos;s quantity demanded would fall from four slices to three slices per day. The change in price from $2 to $3 is a 50 percent increase. The change in quantity demanded from four slices to three is a 25 percent decrease. Dividing the 25 percent decrease in quantity demanded by the 50 percent increase in price gives us an elasticity of demand of 0.5. See Figure 3.6 for another view of this calculation. This illustration is based on the formula from Figure 3.4. Since Ashley&apos;s elasticity of demand at a price change from $2 to $3 is less than 1, we say that Ashley&apos;s demand for pizza is inelastic.

    <page pageNumber="156"> <text><![CDATA[ words, price increase has a relatively small effect on the number of slices of pizza she buys. Suppose we survey another customer and find that when the price of pizza rises by 40 percent, this person&apos;s quantity demanded falls by 60 percent. Recall again the formula from Figure 3.4: The change in the quantity demanded of 60 percent is divided by the change in price of 40 percent, equaling an elasticity of demand of 1.5 (60 percent/40 percent = 1.5). Since this result is greater than 1, this customer&apos;s demand is elastic. In other words, this customer is very sensitive to changes in the price of pizza. dEfINE How do economists calculate elasticity? Factors Affecting Elasticity Why is the demand for some goods so much less elastic than for other goods? Rephrase the question and ask yourself, “What is essential to me? What goods must I have, even if the price rises greatly?” The goods you list might have some traits that set them apart from other goods and make your demand for those goods less elastic. Several different factors, including several non-price determinants, can affect a person&apos;s elasticity of demand for a specific good. Availability of Substitutes If there are few substitutes for a good, then even when its price rises greatly, you might still buy it. You believe you have no good alternatives. For example, if your favorite musical group plans to give a concert that you want to attend, there really is no substitute for that ticket. You could go to a concert to hear some other band, but that would not be as good. You&apos;ve got to have tickets for this concert, and nothing else will do. Under these circumstances, a moderate change in price is not going to change your mind. Your demand for that concert is inelastic. Similarly, demand for life-saving medicine is usually inelastic. For many prescription drugs, the only possible substitute is to try an unproven treatment. For this reason, people with an illness will continue to buy as much of the necessary medicine as they can afford, even when the price goes up. If the lack of substitutes can make demand inelastic, a wide choice of substitute goods can make demand elastic. The demand for a particular brand of apple juice is probably elastic because people can choose from several good substitutes if the price of their preferred brand rises.

Apply Concepts How would you describe Ashley&apos;s response to a small price increase? Relative Importance A second factor in determining a good&apos;s elasticity of demand is how much of your budget you spend on the good. If you already spend a large share of your income on a good, a price increase will force you to make some tough choices. Unless you want to cut back drastically on the other goods in your budget, you must reduce consumption of that particular good by a significant amount to keep your budget under control. The higher the jump in price, the more you will have to adjust your purchases. If you currently spend half of your budget on clothes, even a modest increase in the cost of clothing will probably cause a large reduction in the quantity you purchase. In other words, your demand will be elastic. However, if the price of shoelaces doubled, would you cut back on your shoelace purchases? Probably not. You may not even notice the difference. Even if you spend twice as much on shoelaces, they will still account for only a tiny part of your overall budget. Your demand for shoelaces is inelastic. Necessities Versus Luxuries The third factor in determining a good&apos;s elasticity varies a great deal from person to person, but it is nonetheless important. Whether a person considers a good to be a necessity or a luxury has a great impact on a person&apos;s elasticity of demand for that good. A necessity is a good people will always buy, even when the price increases. Parents often regard milk as a necessity. They will buy it at any reasonable price. If the price of a gallon of milk rises from $3.49 to $5.49, they will still buy as much milk as their children need to stay healthy. Their demand for milk is inelastic. The same parents may regard steak as a luxury. When the price of steak increases slightly, say 20 percent, parents may cut their monthly purchases of steak by more than 20 percent, or skip steak altogether. Steak is a luxury, and consumers can easily reduce the quantity they consume. Because it is easy to reduce the quantity of luxury goods demanded, demand is elastic. Change Over Time When a price changes, consumers often need time to change their spending habits. Consumers do not always react quickly to a price increase, because it takes time to find substitutes. Because they cannot respond quickly to price changes, their demand is inelastic in the short term. Demand sometimes becomes more elastic over time, however, because people can eventually find substitutes. Consider the example of gasoline. A person might purchase a large vehicle that requires a greater 3.3 Elasticity of Demand 91 ]]></text>

These factors determine how much gasoline this person demands, and none can be changed easily. In the early 1970s, several oil-rich countries cut their oil exports to the United States. Gasoline prices rose quickly. In the short term, people could do little to reduce their consumption of gasoline. They still needed to drive to school and work. At first, drivers were more likely to pay the higher price for gasoline than they were to buy fuel-efficient cars or move closer to their workplaces. However, because gas prices stayed high for a considerable period of time, some people eventually switched to more fuel-efficient cars, formed car pools, or used public transportation. In the long run, people reduced their consumption of gasoline by finding substitutes. Demand for gasoline, inelastic in the short term, is more elastic in the long term. The story did not end there. In the early 1980s, the price of a gallon of gas began to fall. Gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, stayed low for the next two decades. At first, people continued to buy fuel-efficient cars. But over time, many Americans switched to larger vehicles that got fewer miles to the gallon. Because the price of gas remained low, people gradually adjusted their habits and consumed more gasoline. Just as demand for gasoline responded slowly to an increase in price, it also responded slowly to a decrease in price. In the early 2000s, gasoline prices shot up again and have remained fairly high. At first, consumers were slow to change their car-buying habits and their demand for gasoline. Eventually, however, more fuel-efficient cars, including electrically powered models, gained a foothold in the market. If gas prices remain high over the long term, economists expect that demand for gasoline will grow increasingly elastic. IdENTIfy What factors affect elasticity of demand? How Elasticity Affects Revenue Elasticity is important to the study of economics because elasticity helps us measure how consumers respond to price changes for different products. Elasticity is also an important tool for business planners, like the pizzeria owner described earlier in this topic. The elasticity of demand determines how a change in prices will affect a firm&apos;s total revenue, or income. FACTORS AFFECTING ELASTICITY AFTER PRICE INCREASE Availability of Substitutes More substitutes available usually means more elasticity. Necessity or Luxury? Demand for necessities is inelastic, and demand for luxuries is elastic. Passage of Time The passage of time often increases elasticity in demand. Relative Importance to Budget The greater the impact on the budget, the more elastic the demand. >> Several factors explain why elasticity of demand can vary.

Analyze Charts Why does revenue for this restaurant fall when price increases from $4 to $5? Total Revenue A company&apos;s total revenue is defined as the amount of money the company receives by selling its goods. This is determined by two factors: the price of the goods and the quantity sold. For example, if a pizzeria sells 150 slices of pizza per day at $4 per slice, total revenue would be $600 per day. Total Revenue and Elastic Demand The law of demand tells us that an increase in price will decrease the quantity demanded. When a good has an elastic demand, raising the price of each unit sold by 20 percent will decrease the quantity sold by a larger percentage, say 50 percent. The quantity sold will drop enough to actually reduce the firm&apos;s total revenue. The revenue table in Figure 3.7&ndash;drawn from the pizzeria&apos;s demand curve&ndash;shows how this can happen. An increase in price from $5 to $6, or 20 percent, decreases the quantity sold from 100 to 50, or 50 percent. As a result, total revenue drops from $500 to $300. The same process can also work in reverse. If the firm were to reduce the price by a certain percentage, the quantity demanded could rise by an even greater percentage. In this case, total revenues could rise. It may surprise you that a firm could lose revenue by raising the price of its goods. But if the pizzeria started selling pizza at $10 a slice, it would not stay in business very long. Remember that elastic demand comes from one or more of these factors: &bull; The availability of substitute goods &bull; A limited budget that does not allow for price changes &bull; The perception of the good as a luxury item If these conditions are present, then the demand for the good is elastic, and a firm may find that a price increase reduces its total revenue. Total Revenue and Inelastic Demand Remember that if demand is inelastic, consumers&apos; demand is not very responsive to price changes. When demand is inelastic, price and total revenue move in the same direction: An increase in price raises total revenue, and a decrease in price reduces total revenue. Thus, if a firm raises its price by 25 percent, the quantity demanded will fall, but not by enough to lower total revenue. As a result, the firm will have greater total revenues, because the higher price will make up for the lower quantity of sales. The firm brings in more money. On the other hand, a decrease in price will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded even if demand is inelastic. However, the percentage of increase in the quantity demanded will be less than the percentage of increase in price, and the firm&apos;s total revenue will decrease. For example, if you lower the price of socks by 50 percent, you may sell only 20 percent more socks. The increase in the quantity sold does not compensate for the lost revenue. 3.3 Elasticity of Demand 93 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="160"> <text><![CDATA[ How Elasticity Affects Pricing Policies Because of these relationships, a firm needs to know whether the demand for its product is elastic or inelastic at a given price. This knowledge helps the firm make pricing decisions that lead to the greatest revenue. If a firm knows that the demand for its product is elastic at the current price, it knows that an increase in price might reduce total revenues. During the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, demand for SUVs proved to be elastic. As a result, car manufacturers could not raise prices to compensate for lower sales. On the other hand, suppose a firm knows that the demand for its product is inelastic at its current price. The firm may safely conclude that an increase in price will increase total revenue.

We will now explore the ways in which changes in price affect supply. Suppliers Follow the Law of Supply Supply is the amount of a good or service that is available. How do producers decide how much to supply? According to the law of supply, producers offer more of a good or service as its price increases and less as its price falls. Economists use the term quantity supplied to describe how much of a good or service a producer is willing and able to sell at a specific price. A producer may also be called a supplier, a company, or an owner&ndash;whoever supplies a product to the market. The law of supply develops from the choices of both current and new producers of a good or service. As the price rises, existing firms will produce more in order to earn additional revenue. A price increase is also an incentive for new firms to enter the market to earn their own profits. If the price of a good or service falls, some firms will produce less, and others might drop out of the market.

The Effect of Price on Production If a firm is already earning a profit by selling a good or service, then an increase in the price&ndash;ceteris paribus&ndash;will increase the firm&apos;s profits. The promise of higher revenues generated by each sale encourages the firm to produce more. The pizzeria you read about in prior lessons probably makes a reasonable profit by selling a certain number of slices a day at the market price. If the pizzeria wasn&apos;t making a profit, the owner would raise the price or switch from making pizzas to making something more profitable. If the price of pizza rises, but the firm&apos;s cost of making pizza stays the same, the pizzeria will earn a higher profit on each slice. Any smart entrepreneur would produce and sell more pizza to take advantage of the higher prices. Similarly, if the price of pizza goes down, the pizzeria will earn less profit per slice or even lose money. The owner will choose to sell less pizza and produce something else, such as calzones, which will yield more profit. In both cases, the search for profit drives the supplier&apos;s decision. When the price goes up, the supplier recognizes the chance to make more money and works harder to produce more pizza. When the price falls, the same supplier is discouraged from producing as much as before. The Effect of Price on Number of Suppliers Profits appeal both to producers already in the market and to people who may decide to join the market. As you have seen, when the price of pizza rises, a pizzeria provides a good opportunity to make money. If you were thinking about opening your own restaurant, a pizzeria would look like a good move. This is how rising prices draw new firms into a market and add to the quantity supplied of the good or service. Consider the market for music. In the late 1970s, disco music became popular. The music industry quickly recognized the popularity of disco, and soon, more and more groups released disco recordings. Groups that once recorded soul and rhythm and blues music chose to record disco albums. New entrants crowded the market to take advantage of the potential for profit. Disco, however, was a short- lived fad. By the early 1980s, stores couldn&apos;t sell disco albums. This pattern of sharp increases and decreases in supply occurs again and again in the music industry. In the early 1990s, grunge music emerged from Market price for pizza slices rises from $3 to $4.

Record labels signed more grunge groups to recording contracts. Music stores devoted more space to grunge music. However, grunge soon lost its appeal, and many groups disbanded or moved on to new styles. Other styles of music, such as hip-hop and independent rock, achieved popularity instead. In each of these examples, many musicians joined the market to profit from a trend. Their actions reflected the law of supply, which says that the quantity supplied increases as the price of a good increases. One of the benefits of the economic system of the United States, with its emphasis on free markets, is that markets are open to new suppliers. Entrepreneurs can enter growing markets to respond to these trends as long as they can assemble the needed factors of production and are willing to take the risk. GENERATE ExPLANATIONS Why do rising prices for a good or service have the effect of causing firms to increase production? Understanding Supply Schedules Similar to a demand schedule, a supply schedule shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied for a specific good or service, or how much of a good or service a supplier will offer at various prices. The pizzeria discussed earlier might have a supply schedule that looks like the one in Figure 3.8. This table compares two variables, or factors that can change: the price of a slice of pizza and the number of slices supplied by a pizzeria. We could collect this information by asking the pizzeria owner how many slices she is willing and able to make at different prices. We could also look at records to see how the quantity supplied has varied as the price has changed. We will almost certainly find that at higher prices, the pizzeria owner is willing to make more pizza. At a lower price, she prefers to make less pizza and devote her limited resources to other, more profitable items. Like a demand schedule, a supply schedule lists supply for a very specific set of conditions. The schedule shows how the price of pizza, and only pizza, affects the pizzeria&apos;s output of pizza. Other factors that could change the restaurant&apos;s output of Individual Supply Schedule $1.00 $2.00 $3.00 $4.00 $5.00 $6.00 100 150 200 250 300 350 PRICE PER SLICE OF PIZZA SLICES SUPPLIED PER DAY >> Figure 3.8 This schedule shows how many slices one pizzeria owner will supply at different prices.

Changes in the Quantity Supplied Economists use the word supply to refer to the relationship between price and quantity supplied, as shown in the supply schedule. The pizzeria&apos;s supply of pizza includes all possible combinations of price and output. According to this supply schedule, the pizzeria&apos;s supply is 100 slices at $1 a slice, 150 slices at $2 a slice, 200 slices at $3 a slice, and so on. The number of slices that the pizzeria offers at a specific price is called the quantity supplied at that price. At $5 per slice, the pizzeria&apos;s quantity supplied is 300 slices per day. A rise or fall in the price of pizza will cause the quantity supplied to change, but not the supply schedule. In other words, a change in a good&apos;s price moves the seller from one row to another in the same supply schedule, but it does not change the supply schedule itself. When a factor other than the price of pizza affects output, we have to build a whole new supply schedule to reflect the new market conditions. All Suppliers and the Market Supply Schedule All of the supply schedules of individual firms in a market can be added up to create a market supply schedule. A market supply schedule shows the relationship between prices and the total quantity supplied by all firms in a particular market. This information is needed if we want to determine the Market Supply Schedule $1.00 $2.00 $3.00 $4.00 $5.00 $6.00 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 PRICE PER SLICE OF PIZZA SLICES SUPPLIED PER DAY >> Figure 3.9 This schedule shows how many slices all pizzerias in a market will supply at different prices. Analyze Charts What would you expect to happen in this market if prices dropped to $.50 a slice? total supply of pizza at a certain price in a large area, like a city. The market supply schedule for pizza in Figure 3.9 shows the supply of pizza for a hypothetical city. It resembles the supply schedule for a single pizzeria, but the quantities are much larger. This market supply schedule lists the same prices as those in the supply schedule for the single pizzeria, since all restaurants will charge prices within the same range. The quantities supplied are much larger because there are many pizzerias in the community. Like the individual supply schedule, this market supply schedule reflects the law of supply. Pizzerias supply more pizza at higher prices. The Supply Graph When we graph the data points in the supply schedule, we create a supply graph&ndash; also known as a supply curve. A supply curve is a graphic representation of a supply schedule. A supply curve is very similar to a demand curve, except that the horizontal axis now measures the quantity of the good supplied, not the quantity demanded. The graph on the left in Figure 3.10 shows a supply curve for one pizzeria. The graph on the right shows a market supply curve, which applies to all the pizzerias in the city. The data used to draw the two graphs are from the two supply schedules in Figure 3.8 and Figure 3.9. The prices shown along the vertical axes are the same in both graphs. However, the quantities of pizza supplied at each price are much larger in the market supply curve. The key feature of the supply curve is that it always rises from left to right. That is, the curve moves toward higher and higher output levels (on the horizontal axis) and higher and higher prices (on the vertical axis) as you move from left to right. This change, of course, illustrates the law of supply, which says that a higher price leads to higher output. SUMMARIzE What does a supply schedule show? Elasticity of Supply Earlier you learned that elasticity of demand measures how consumers will react to price changes. Elasticity of supply is based on the same concept. Elasticity of supply measures how firms will respond to changes in the price of a good or service. The labels elastic, inelastic, and unitary elastic represent the same values of elasticity in relation 98 TOPIC 3 Demand, Supply, and Prices ]]></text>

Bounce to Activate Chart to supply as they do in relation to demand. When elasticity is greater than 1, supply is very sensitive to changes in price and is considered elastic. If supply is not very responsive to changes in price, and elasticity is less than 1, supply is considered inelastic. When a percentage change in price is perfectly matched by an equal percentage change in quantity supplied, elasticity is exactly 1, and supply is unitary elastic. What determines whether the supply of a good will be elastic or inelastic? The key factor is time. In the short run, some firms cannot easily change their output levels, making supply inelastic. In the long run, those firms can be more flexible, and supply becomes more elastic. Of course, different kinds of businesses have more flexibility in the short term, so, for them, supply can be elastic even in the short run. Elasticity of Supply Over a Short Time An orange grove is one example of a business that has difficulty adjusting to a change in price in the short term. Orange trees take several years to mature and grow fruit. If the price of oranges goes up, an orange grower can buy and plant more trees, but he will have to wait several years for this investment to pay off. However, the grower could still take smaller steps to increase output in the short term. For example, he could use a more effective pesticide. While this step might increase his output somewhat, it would probably not dramatically increase the number of oranges produced. Economists would say that the orange grower&apos;s supply is inelastic in the short run, because he cannot easily change his output. The same factors that prevent the owner of the orange grove from expanding supply would also prevent new growers from entering the market and supplying oranges in the short term. In the short term, the supply of oranges is also inelastic if the price decreases. If the price of oranges falls, the grove owner has few ways to cut his supply. Years ago, he invested in land and trees, and his grove will provide oranges&ndash;not apples or pears or grapefruit&ndash;no matter what the price is. Even if the price drops drastically, the grove owner will probably pick and sell nearly as many oranges as before. His competitors have also invested heavily in land and trees and won&apos;t drop out of the market if they can survive. Other businesses have a more elastic supply even in the short term. For example, a business that provides a service, such as a haircut, is highly elastic. The supply of haircuts is easily expanded or reduced. If the price rises, barbershops and salons can hire workers fairly quickly or extend their business hours. In addition, new barbershops and salons will open. This means that a small increase in price will cause 3.4 Fundamentals of Supply 99 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="166"> <text><![CDATA[ a large increase in quantity supplied, even in the short term. If the price of a haircut drops, some shop owners will lay off workers or close earlier in the day. Others will leave the market. Quantity supplied will fall quickly. Because haircut suppliers can quickly change their operations, the supply of haircuts is elastic even in the short run. Elasticity of Supply Over a Longer Time Like demand, supply becomes more elastic over time. The orange grower could not increase his output much when the price of oranges rose, but he can plant more trees to increase his supply over time. After several years, he will be able to sell more oranges at the higher price. If the price drops and stays low for several years, orange growers who survived the first two or three years of losses might decide to leave the market and grow something else. With five years to respond to changing prices instead of five weeks, orange growers can better adapt to the change in prices. As a result, the supply of oranges is far more elastic in the long run than it is in the short run. APPLy CONCEPTS How does a business that is highly elastic respond to a drop in prices?

You&apos;ll also see what happens when a factory&apos;s operating costs are greater than its revenue. How Many Workers to Hire One basic question that any business owner has to answer is how many workers to hire. Owners have to consider how the number of workers they hire will affect their total production. For example, at the beanbag factory, one worker can produce four beanbags per hour. Two workers can make a total of ten bags per hour, and three can make a total of 17 beanbags per hour. As each new worker joins the company, total output increases. After the seventh worker is hired, production peaks at 32 beanbags per hour. When the firm hires the eighth worker, however, total output drops to 31 bags per hour. Marginal Product of Labor The relationship between labor, measured by the number of workers in the factory and the number of beanbags produced, is shown in Figure 3.11. This table details the marginal product of labor, or the change in output from hiring one more worker. This is called the marginal product VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="168"> <text><![CDATA[ because it measures the change in output at the margin, where the last worker has been hired or fired. The first worker hired produces four bags an hour, so her marginal product of labor is four bags. The second worker raises total output from four bags per hour to ten, so her marginal product of labor is six. In fact, Figure 3.11 shows that the marginal product of labor increases for the first three workers, rising from four to seven. Increasing Marginal Returns The marginal product of labor increases for the first three workers because there are three tasks involved in making a beanbag. Workers cut cloth into the correct shape, stuff it with beans, and sew the bag closed. A single worker performing all these tasks can produce only four bags per hour. Adding a second worker allows each worker to specialize in one or two tasks. If each worker focuses on only one part of the process, she wastes less time switching between tasks and becomes more skillful at her assigned task. Because specialization increases output per worker, the second worker adds more to output than the first. The firm enjoys increasing marginal returns. In our example, there are benefits from specialization. The firm enjoys a rising marginal product of labor for the first three workers. Marginal Product of Labor Diminishing Marginal Returns When workers four through seven are hired, the marginal product of labor is still positive. Each new worker still adds to total output. However, the marginal product of labor shrinks as each worker joins the company. The fourth worker increases output by six bags, while the seventh increases output by only one bag. Why? After the beanbag firm hires its first three workers, one for each task, the benefits of specialization end. At that point, adding more workers increases total output, but at a decreasing rate. This situation is known as diminishing marginal returns. A firm with diminishing marginal returns of labor will produce less and less output from each additional unit of labor. You can observe this effect (and the effect of increasing marginal returns) in graph form in Figure 3.12. The firm suffers from diminishing marginal returns of labor because its workers have a limited amount of capital. Capital&ndash;any human- made resource used to produce other goods&ndash;is represented by the factory&apos;s single sewing machine and its pair of scissors. With three workers, only one needs to use the sewing machine, so this worker never has to wait to get to work. When there are more than three workers, the factory may assign more than one to work at the sewing machine.

Explain Which categories of cost would increase for a business that decided to extend its hours of operation? So while one works, the other worker waits. He or she may cut fabric or stuff bags, but every bag must be sewn at some point, so the worker cannot greatly increase the speed of production. The problem gets worse as more workers are hired and the amount of capital remains constant. Time wasted waiting for the sewing machine or scissors means that additional workers will add less and less to total output. Negative Marginal Returns As the table in Figure 3.11 and the graph in Figure 3.12 show, adding an eighth worker actually decreases output by one bag. This is called negative marginal return. At this stage, workers get in each other&apos;s way and disrupt production, so overall output decreases. Of course, few companies ever hire so many workers that their marginal product of labor becomes negative. APPLy CONCEPTS How does the amount of capital in an enterprise affect marginal returns? Production Costs Paying workers and purchasing capital are both costs of producing goods. Economists divide a producer&apos;s costs into two main categories: fixed costs and variable costs. These ideas are described below. Fixed Costs A fixed cost is a cost that does not change, no matter how much of a good is produced. Most fixed costs involve the property or production facility&ndash;the cost of building and equipping a factory, office, store, or restaurant. Examples of fixed costs include rent, machinery repairs, property taxes, and the salaries of workers who run the business even when production temporarily stops. Variable Costs Variable costs are costs that rise or fall depending on the quantity produced. They include the costs of raw materials and some labor. For example, to produce more beanbags, the firm must purchase more beans and hire more workers. If the company wants to produce less and cut costs, it can buy fewer beans or reduce weekly hours for some workers. The cost of labor is a variable cost because it changes with the number of workers, which changes with the quantity produced. Electricity and heating bills are also variable costs, because the company only uses heat and electricity during business hours.

    <page pageNumber="170"> <text><![CDATA[ factory is fully equipped to produce beanbags. How does the cost of producing beanbags change as the output increases? In our example, the fixed costs are the costs of the factory building and all the machinery and equipment. As shown in the second column in Figure 3.13, the fixed costs are $36 per hour. Variable costs include the cost of beans, fabric, and most of the workers. As shown in the third column, variable costs rise with the number of beanbags produced. Fixed and variable costs added together make up the total cost, shown in the fourth column. Marginal Cost If we know the total cost at several levels of output, we can determine the marginal cost of production at each level. Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit. In Figure 3.13, you see that even if the firm makes no beanbags, it still must pay $36 per hour in fixed costs. If the firm produces one beanbag per hour, its total cost rises by $8, from $36 to $44 per hour. The marginal cost of the first beanbag is $8. For the first three beanbags, marginal cost falls as output increases. The marginal cost is $4 for the second beanbag and $3 for the third.

Analyze Graphs What is the marginal product of labor when a fifth worker is added? beanbag is cheaper to make because of increasing marginal returns resulting from specialization. At four beanbags per hour, marginal cost starts to rise. The marginal cost of the fifth beanbag per hour is $7, the sixth costs $9, and the seventh, $12. The rising marginal cost reflects diminishing returns of labor. The benefits of specialization are exhausted at three beanbags per hour. Diminishing returns set in as more workers share a fixed production facility. ChECK UNdERSTANdING Why might a closed factory still have production costs? Setting Output Behind all of the hiring decisions is the firm&apos;s basic goal: to maximize profits. Profit is defined as total revenue minus total cost. A firm&apos;s total revenue is the money the firm gets by selling its product. Total revenue is equal to the price of each good multiplied by the number of goods sold. Total revenue when the price of a beanbag is $24 is shown in Figure 3.13. To find the level of output with the highest profit, we look for the biggest gap between total revenue and total cost. The gap is greatest and profit is highest when the firm makes 9 or 10 beanbags per hour. At this rate, the firm can expect to make a profit. Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost Another way to find the best level of output is to find the output level where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. Marginal revenue is the additional income from selling one more unit of a good. If the firm has no control over the market price, marginal revenue equals the market price. Each beanbag sold at $24 increases the firm&apos;s total revenue by $24, so marginal revenue is $24. According to the table, price equals marginal cost with ten beanbags, so that is the quantity that maximizes profit at $98 per hour. To understand how an output of ten beanbags maximizes the firm&apos;s profits, suppose that the firm made only four beanbags per hour. Is it making as much money as it can? From Figure 3.13, we know that the marginal cost of the fifth beanbag is $7. The market price for a beanbag is $24, so the marginal revenue from that beanbag is $24. The $17 difference between the marginal revenue and marginal cost represents pure profit for the company from the fifth beanbag. The company should increase production to five beanbags an hour to capture that profit on the fifth beanbag. Bounce to Activate Chart 104 TOPIC 3 Demand, Supply, and Prices ]]></text>

Apply Concepts Why might this factory not seek the highest possible revenue? Bounce to Activate Illustration The same calculations show that the company can capture a profit of $15 by producing a sixth beanbag per hour. The price of the seventh beanbag is $12 higher than its marginal cost, so that beanbag earns an additional $12 in profit for the company. The profit is available any time the company receives more for the last beanbag than the cost to produce it. Any rational entrepreneur would take this opportunity to increase profit. Now suppose that the firm is producing so many beanbags per hour that marginal cost is higher than price. If the firm produces eleven beanbags per hour, it receives $24 for that eleventh beanbag, but the $30 cost of producing that beanbag wipes out the profit. The firm actually loses $6 on the sale of the eleventh beanbag. Because marginal cost is increasing and price is constant in this example, the losses get worse at higher levels of output. The company would be better off producing less and keeping costs down. The ideal level of output is where marginal revenue (price) is equal to marginal cost. Any other quantity of output would generate less profit. Profit can be determined by subtracting total cost from total revenue. We can also determine profit by comparing price and average cost. Average cost is total cost divided by the quantity produced. At an output of 10 beanbags per hour, the average cost is $14.20 ($142&ndash;total cost&ndash;divided by 10). Profit is the difference between market price and average cost ($24 &ndash; 14.20 = $9.80) multiplied by the quantity ($9.80 X 10 = $98). Again, these numbers appear in Figure 3.13. Responding to Price Changes What happens if the price of a beanbag rises from $24 to $37? Thinking at the margin, the firm would probably increase production to 12 beanbags per hour. At that quantity, marginal cost is equal to the new, higher price. At the original price of $24, the firm would not produce more than ten beanbags, according to Figure 3.14. When the price rises to $37, marginal revenue soars above marginal cost at that output level. By raising production to 12 beanbags per hour, the firm earns profits on the eleventh and twelfth beanbags. This example shows the law of supply in action. An increase in price from $24 to $37 causes the firm to increase the quantity supplied from 10 to 12 beanbags per hour. The Shutdown Decision Consider the problems faced by a factory that is losing money. The factory is producing at the most profitable level of output, where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. However, the market price is so low that the factory&apos;s total revenue is still less than its total cost, and the 3.5 Costs of Production 105 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="172"> <text><![CDATA[ firm is losing money. Should this factory continue to produce goods and lose money, or should its owners shut the factory down? In fact, there are times when keeping a money- losing factory open is the best choice. The firm should keep the factory open if the total revenue from the goods the factory produces is greater than the cost of keeping it open. For example, if the price of beanbags drops to $7 and the factory produces at the profit-maximizing level of five beanbags per hour, the total revenue drops from $120 per hour to $35 per hour. Weigh this against the factory&apos;s operating cost, the cost of operating the facility. Operating cost includes the variable costs the owners must pay to keep the factory running, but not fixed costs, which the owners must pay whether the factory is open or closed. According to Figure 3.13, if the factory produces five beanbags per hour, the variable cost is $27 per hour. Therefore, the benefit of operating the facility (total revenue of $35) is greater than the variable cost ($27), so it makes sense to keep the facility running. Consider the effects of the other choice. If the firm shuts down the factory, it would still have to pay all of its fixed costs. The factory&apos;s total revenue would be zero, because it produces nothing for sale. Therefore, the firm would lose an amount of money equal to its fixed costs. For this beanbag factory, the fixed costs equal $36 per hour, so the factory would lose $36 for Output and a Change in Price each hour it is closed. If the factory produced five beanbags per hour, its total cost would be $63 ($36 in fixed costs plus $27 in variable costs) per hour, but it would lose only $28 ($63 in total cost minus $35 in revenue) for each hour it is open. The factory would lose less money while producing because the total revenue ($35) would exceed the variable costs ($27), leaving $8 to cover some of the fixed costs. Although the factory would lose money either way, it would lose less money by continuing to produce and sell beanbags. When will a business replace a factory that is operating at a loss? The firm will build a new factory and stay in the market only if the market price of beanbags is high enough to cover all the costs of production, including the cost of building a new factory. Note also that a business that owns an unprofitable property can sell it. There are costs to disposing of business property&ndash;for example, the loss of the opportunity to take advantage of future market conditions. But disposing of business property can also yield benefits, such as income from sale of the property and relief from the fixed costs. These costs and benefits must be considered in any shutdown decision. ExPRESS IdEAS CLEARLy Under what circumstances should a firm keep a money-losing factory open?

Explain how firms choose a location to produce goods. >> Key Terms subsidy excise tax regulation Changes in Supply Input Costs and Changes in Supply Several factors, including the number of suppliers in a market, can lead to a shift in the supply curve. Government actions and global events also have an impact on supply. A very important influence on supply, though, is suppliers&apos; input costs. Any change in the cost of an input used to produce a good&ndash; such as raw materials, machinery, or labor&ndash;will affect supply. A rise in the cost of an input will cause a fall in supply at all price levels because the good has become more expensive to produce. On the other hand, a fall in the cost of an input will cause an increase in supply at all price levels. The Effect of Input Costs on Supply Think of the effects of input costs on the relationship between marginal revenue (price) and marginal cost. A supplier sets output at the most profitable level, where price is equal to marginal cost. Since marginal cost includes the cost of the inputs that go into production, a rise in the cost of labor or raw materials will result in a higher marginal cost. If the cost of inputs increases enough, the marginal cost may become higher than the price, and the firm may not be as profitable.

    <page pageNumber="175"> <text><![CDATA[ If a firm has no control over the price, the only solution is to cut production and lower marginal cost until marginal cost equals the lower price. Supply falls at each price, and the supply curve shifts to the left, as illustrated in Figure 3.15. The Effect of Technology on Input Costs Input costs can drop as well. Advances in technology can lower production costs in many industries. Automation, including the use of robotic tools, has spread throughout the manufacturing sector, saving on labor costs. Computers have simplified tasks and cut costs in many fields. Web-based conferencing makes it possible for individuals in different locations to meet while eliminating travel costs. Future advances promise to decrease production costs even further. Technology lowers costs and increases supply at all price levels. This effect is seen in a rightward shift in the supply curve in Figure 3.15. ANALyzE ChARTS The rightward shift in the supply curve associated with lower input costs signifies what kind of change in supply? Shifts in the Supply Curve Government Policies and Changes in Supply The government has the power to affect the supplies of many types of goods. By raising or lowering the cost of producing goods, the government can encourage or discourage an entrepreneur or an industry within the country or abroad. Subsidies and Supply One method governments use to affect supply is to give subsidies to producers of a good. A subsidy is a government payment that supports a business or market. Government often pays a producer a set subsidy for each unit produced. Subsidies generally lower costs, allowing a firm to produce more goods. They are particularly common with food production. Governments have several reasons for subsidizing producers, and these reasons can change over time. During and after World War II, European countries faced food shortages. Today, European governments protect farms so that some will be available to grow food in case cheaper imports are ever restricted. The French government subsidizes small farms to protect the lifestyle and character of the French countryside. Governments in developing countries often subsidize manufacturers to protect young, growing industries from strong foreign competition.

In Western Europe, banks and national airlines were allowed to suffer huge losses with the assurance that the government would cover their debts. In recent years, many governments have stopped providing industrial subsidies in the interest of free trade and fair competition. In the United States, the federal government subsidizes producers in many industries. Farm subsidies are particularly controversial, especially when farmers are paid to take land out of cultivation to keep prices high. In these cases, more efficient farmers are penalized, and farmers use more herbicides and pesticides on lands they do cultivate to compensate for production lost on the acres the government pays them not to plant. Excise Taxes and Supply A government can reduce the supply of some goods by placing an excise tax on them. An excise tax is a tax on the production or sale of a good. An excise tax increases production costs by adding an extra cost for each unit sold. Excise taxes are sometimes used to discourage the sale of goods that the government thinks are >> Regulations about the removal and disposal of hazardous wastes from factories add cost to business that can affect supply. harmful to the public good, like cigarettes, alcohol, and high-pollutant gasoline. Excise taxes are indirect&ndash;they are built into the price of the good&ndash; so consumers may not realize that they are paying them. Like any increase in cost, an excise tax causes the supply of a good to decrease at all price levels, shifting the supply curve to the left. The Role of Government Rules and Regulations In the case of subsidies and excise taxes, government directly affects supply by changing revenue or production costs. Government can also raise or lower supply through indirect means. Government regulation often has the effect of raising costs. Regulation is government intervention in a market that affects the price, quantity, or quality of a good. Some government regulation aims to ensure the safety of products. The federal government&apos;s Food Safety Inspection Service, for instance, inspects livestock, poultry, and eggs to ensure that the food supply is healthy. The Consumer Product Safety Commission works to minimize the risk of injury to people who use a wide variety of consumer products. Government regulation has its drawbacks, however. Even members of government recognize the burden that regulation can place on business. In a 2006 speech to the Economic Club of New York, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. described how over-regulation of business can affect economic progress: Excessive regulation slows innovation, imposes needless costs on investors, and stifles competitiveness and job creation. &ndash;Henry M. Paulson Jr., Secretary of the Treasury, washingtonpost.com, Nov. 11, 2006 Government regulation can change over time. For many years, the government did nothing to regulate automobile exhaust. People began to be concerned that exhaust was harming the environment. Starting in 1970, the federal government required car manufacturers to install technology to reduce this pollution. For example, new cars had to use lead-free fuel because scientists linked health problems to lead in gasoline. These regulations increased the cost of manufacturing cars and reduced the supply.

RISEPRICES WILL SUPPLY AND THE EXPECTATION OF FUTURE PRICES >> Summarize How does expectation of future prices affect supply? Other Non-Price Determinants That Create Changes in Supply While input costs and government can have an important influence on the supply of goods, there are other important factors that influence supply. They include changes in the global economy and the number of competitors in a market. Changes in the Global Economy and Supply A large and rising share of goods and services consumed by Americans is imported. Naturally, the supply of imported goods is affected by conditions in other countries. Here are just two examples of possible changes in the supply of products imported by the United States. &bull; The U.S. imports carpets from India. An increase in the wages of Indian workers would decrease the supply of carpets to the U.S. market, shifting the supply curve to the left. &bull; The United States imports oil from Russia. A new oil discovery in Russia could increase the supply of oil to the U.S. market and shift the supply curve to the right. Import restrictions also affect supply. The total supply of a product equals the sum of imports and domestically produced products. An import ban on sugar would eliminate foreign sugar suppliers from the market, shifting the market supply curve to the left. If government restricted imports by establishing an import quota rather than a ban, the supply curve would shift to the left, but to a smaller degree. Expectations About Prices and Supply If you were a soybean farmer, and you expected the price of soybeans to double next month, what would you do with the crop that you just harvested? Most farmers would store their soybeans until the price rose, cutting back supply in the short term. If a seller expects the price of a good to rise in the future, the seller will store the goods now in order to sell more in the future at a higher price. But if the price of the good is expected to drop in the near future, the suppliers will earn more money by selling their goods immediately, before the price falls. Expectations of higher prices reduce supply now and increase supply later. Expectations of lower prices have the opposite effect. Inflation is a condition of generally rising prices. During periods of inflation, the value of the cash in a person&apos;s pocket decreases from day to day as prices rise. Over many years, inflation has reduced the value of the dollar. However, some goods continue to hold their value if they can be stored for a long period of time. When 3.6 Changes in Supply 111 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="178"> <text><![CDATA[ faced with inflation, suppliers prefer to hold on to these goods that maintain their value rather than sell them for cash that is losing its value rapidly. In this way, inflation affects supply by encouraging suppliers to hold on to goods as long as possible. In the short term, supply can fall dramatically. During the Civil War, the South faced terrible inflation. There were shortages of food, and shopkeepers knew that prices on basic items like flour, butter, and salt would rise each month. A few decided to hoard these goods and wait for higher prices. They succeeded too well; the supply of food fell so much that prices rose out of the reach of many families. Riots broke out in Virginia and elsewhere when hungry people decided they weren&apos;t going to wait for the food to be released from the warehouses, and the shopkeepers lost their goods and their profits. Changes in the Number of Competitors and Supply Another factor to consider when looking at changes in supply is the number of suppliers in the market. If more suppliers enter a market to produce a certain good, the market supply of the good will rise, and the supply curve will shift to the right. However, if suppliers stop producing the good and leave the market, the supply will decline. There is a positive >> It is common for multiple businesses to supply the same product in the same area. relationship between the number of suppliers in a market and the market supply of the good. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT Explain what happens to supply if the price of a good is expected to rise in the near future. Deciding Where to Locate So far, we have ignored the issue of where firms locate their production facilities. For many firms, the key factor is the cost of transportation&ndash;both the cost of transporting inputs to a production facility and the cost of transporting the finished product to consumers. Firms locate close to input suppliers when inputs, such as raw materials, are expensive to transport. They locate close to consumers when output is more costly to transport. Consider the example of a firm that processes tomatoes into tomato sauce. Suppose that the firm uses seven tons of tomatoes to produce one ton of sauce. The firm locates its plant close to the tomato fields&ndash;and far from its consumers&ndash; because it is much cheaper to ship one ton of sauce to consumers than to ship seven tons of tomatoes to a faraway plant. Tomato sauce producers cluster in places like California&apos;s Central Valley, where weather and soil conditions are favorable for the growing of tomatoes. Now consider the example of a firm that bottles soft drinks. The firm combines concentrated syrup with local water, so the firm&apos;s output (bottled drinks) weighs more than its transportable input (syrup). As a result, the firm locates close to its consumers&ndash; and far from its syrup supplier&ndash;because it saves more on transporting soft drinks than it pays to transport its syrup. In general, if a firm&apos;s output is bulky or perishable, the firm will locate close to its consumers. Other firms establish themselves close to inputs that cannot be transported at all. Some firms locate near concentrations of specialized workers such as artists, engineers, and computer programmers. Other firms are pulled toward locations with low energy costs. Many firms locate in urban areas because of the rich variety of workers and business services available there.

You&apos;ll also see why free markets usually produce some of their best outcomes when they are left to operate on their own, free from government intervention. We begin by looking at a supply and demand schedule. As you know, a demand schedule shows how much of a good consumers are willing to buy at various prices. A supply schedule shows how much firms are willing to sell at various prices. Comparing these schedules will help us to find common ground for the two sides of the market.

    <page pageNumber="181"> <text><![CDATA[ Balancing Supply and Demand The point at which demand and supply come together is called the equilibrium. Equilibrium is the point of balance at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. At equilibrium, the market for a good is stable. To find the equilibrium price and quantity, simply look for the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. In the combined supply and demand schedule for a pizza market in Figure 3.16, this occurs at a price of $3 per slice. As you know, supply and demand schedules can be graphed. Look at the three graphs in Figure 3.17. The first two graphs are the demand curve and the supply curve for pizza slices from earlier lessons. The third graph, Finding Equilibrium, combines the first two graphs. This graph shows both the number of slices that consumers in a market will buy at various prices and the number of slices that pizzerias will supply. To find the equilibrium price and quantity on the graph, locate the point at which the supply curve and the demand curve intersect. At that point, quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. As you can see, the supply and demand curves intersect at $3 per slice. At that price and only at that price, the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal, at 200 slices per day. At that price, the market is in a state of equilibrium. Benefits to Buyers and Sellers In any market, supply and demand will be equal at only one price and one quantity. At this equilibrium price, buyers will purchase exactly as much of a good as firms are willing to sell. Buyers who are willing to purchase goods at the equilibrium price will find ample supplies on store shelves. Firms that sell at the equilibrium price will find enough buyers for their goods. When a market is at equilibrium, both buyers and sellers benefit. IdENTIfy CENTRAL ISSUES At what point on a combined supply and demand graph is the market at equilibrium? Effects of Disequilibrium If the market price or quantity supplied is anywhere but at the equilibrium, the market is in a state of disequilibrium. Disequilibrium occurs when quantity supplied is not equal to quantity demanded in a market. In Figure 3.17, disequilibrium occurs at any price other than $3 per slice and at any quantity other than 200 slices. Disequilibrium can produce one of two outcomes: shortage or surplus. Shortage The problem of shortage&ndash;also known as excess demand&ndash;exists when the quantity demanded in a market is more than the quantity supplied. When the actual price in a market is below the equilibrium price, you have a shortage, because the low price encourages buyers and discourages sellers. For example, in Figure 3.17, a price of $2 per slice of pizza will lead to a quantity demanded of Combined Supply and Demand Schedule 300 250 200 150 100 50 $1.00 $2.00 $3.00 $4.00 $5.00 $6.00 100 150 200 250 300 350 Shortage from excess demand Surplus from excess supply Equilibrium PRICE OF A SLICE OF PIZZA QUANTITY DEMANDED QUANTITY SUPPLIED RESULT >> Figure 3.16 Market equilibrium is found at the price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.

When customers want to buy 100 more slices of pizza than restaurants are willing and able to sell, these customers will have to wait in long lines for their pizza, and some will have to do without. In the graph on the far left of Figure 3.18, we have illustrated the shortage at $2 per slice by drawing a dashed line across the graph at that price. If you were running the pizzeria, and you noticed long lines of customers waiting to buy your pizza at $2 per slice, what would you do? Assuming that you like to earn profits, you would probably raise the price. As the price increased, you would be willing to work harder and bake more pizzas, because you would know you could earn more money for each slice you sell. Moving From Shortage to Equilibrium Of course, as the price rises, customers will buy less pizza, since it is becoming relatively more expensive. When the price reaches $3 per slice, you will find that you are earning more profit and can keep up with demand, but the lines are much shorter. Some days you may throw out a few leftover slices, and other days you may have to throw an extra pizza or two in the oven to keep up with customers, but on the whole, you are meeting the needs of your customers. In other words, the market is now at equilibrium. Finding Equilibrium As long as there is a shortage and the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, suppliers will keep raising the price. When the price has risen enough to close the gap, suppliers will have found the highest price that the market will bear. They will continue to sell at that price until some factor changes either the demand or the supply curve, creating new pressures to raise or lower prices and, eventually, a new equilibrium. Non-price determinants that can shift the demand curve include changes in income, consumer expectations, and population. Factors that can shift the supply curve include changes in input costs, government regulations, and the number of suppliers. Surplus If the price is too high, the market will face the problem of surplus, also known as excess supply. A surplus exists when quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded and the actual price of a good is higher than the equilibrium price. (See Figure 3.19.) For example, at a price of $4 per slice of pizza, the quantity supplied of 250 slices per day is much greater than the quantity demanded of 150 slices per day. This means that pizzeria owners will be making 100 more slices of pizza each day than they can sell at that price. The relatively high price encourages pizzeria owners to make more pizza, but it discourages customers from buying pizza, since it is relatively Equilibrium SupplyDemand 0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 100 200 300 Price (per slice) Slices of pizza (per day) 400 Demand Curve 0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 100 200 300 Price (per slice) Slices of pizza (per day) 400 Supply Curve 0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 100 200 300 Price (per slice) Slices of pizza (per day) 400 Finding Equilibrium >> Figure 3.17 Analyze Graphs a.

Some customers will buy one slice instead of two, while others will eat elsewhere. At the end of the day, it is likely that 100 slices will have to be thrown out. Moving From Surplus to Equilibrium Before long, pizzeria owners will get tired of throwing out unsold pizza and will cut their prices. As the price falls, the quantity demanded will rise, and more customers will buy more pizza. At the same time, pizzeria owners will supply fewer pizzas. This process will continue until the price reaches the equilibrium price of $3 per slice. At that price, the amount of pizza that pizzeria owners are willing and able to sell is exactly equal to the amount that their customers are willing and able to buy. Whenever the market is in disequilibrium and prices are flexible, market forces will push the market toward the equilibrium. Sellers do not like to waste their resources on a surplus, particularly on goods that cannot be stored for long, like pizza. And when there is a shortage, profit-seeking sellers realize that they can raise prices to earn more profits. For these reasons, market prices move toward the equilibrium level. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS What market condition might cause a pizzeria owner to throw out many slices of pizza at the end of the day? Price Ceilings Markets tend toward equilibrium, but in some cases the government intervenes to control prices. The government can impose a price ceiling, or a maximum price that can be legally charged for a good or service. The price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price. Effects of Government Rent Control A price ceiling is a maximum price, set by law, that sellers can charge for a good or service. The government places price ceilings on some goods that are considered “essential” and might become too expensive for some consumers. For example, in the early 1940s, New York City introduced rent control, or price ceilings placed on apartment rents, to prevent inflation during a housing crisis. Later, other cities imposed rent control to help the poor cut their housing costs and enable them to live in neighborhoods that they could not otherwise afford. Let&apos;s examine how rent control affects the quantity and quality of housing available to consumers. The housing market data for a hypothetical city are shown in Figure 3.20. Look at the graph on the left side of this illustration. The supply and demand curves for two-bedroom apartments meet at the point where the rental price is $900 a month. 3.7 Equilibrium and Price Controls 117 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="184"> <text><![CDATA[ At this equilibrium rent, consumers will demand 30,000 apartments and suppliers will offer 30,000 apartments for rent. Suppose that the city government passes a law that limits the rent on two-bedroom apartments to $600 per month. This price ceiling is below the equilibrium price. The effect on the market is shown in the graph on the right in Figure 3.20. At a price of $600, the quantity of apartments demanded is 45,000, and the quantity supplied is 15,000. At such a low price, apartments seem inexpensive. Many people will try to rent apartments instead of living with their families or investing in their own houses. However, some landlords will have difficulty earning profits or breaking even at these low rents. Fewer new apartment buildings will be built, and older ones might be converted into offices, stores, or condominiums. The result is a shortage of 30,000 apartments. The price ceiling increases the quantity demanded but decreases the quantity supplied. Since rents are not allowed to rise, this shortage will last as long as the price ceiling holds. Cost of Rent Control When the price cannot rise to the equilibrium level, the market must determine which 15,000 of the 45,000 households will get an apartment, and which 30,000 will do without. Although governments usually pass rent control laws to help renters with the greatest need, few of these renters benefit from rent control. Methods besides prices&ndash;including long waiting lists, discrimination by landlords, a lottery system, and even bribery&ndash;may be used to allocate the scarce supply of apartments. Luck becomes an important factor, and sometimes the only way to get a rent- controlled apartment is to inherit it from a parent or grandparent. In addition, since the rent controls limit landlords&apos; profits, landlords may try to increase their income by cutting costs. Why should a landlord give a building a fresh coat of paint and a new garden if he or she can&apos;t earn the money back through higher rent? Besides, if there&apos;s a waiting list to get an apartment, the landlord has no incentive to work hard and attract renters. As a result, many rent-controlled apartment buildings become run-down, and renters may have to wait months to have routine problems fixed. Consequences of Ending Rent Control If rents were allowed to rise to the market equilibrium level, which is $900 per month, the quantity of apartments in the market would actually rise to 30,000 apartments. The market would be in equilibrium, and people who could afford $900 a month would Surplus $6.00 $5.00 $4.00 $3.00 $2.00 $1.00 Price (per slice) Demand Excess SupplySupply Quantity Quantity demanded supplied 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Slices of pizza (per day) >> Figure 3.19 At a certain price, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating a surplus.

Analyze Graphs Why does rent control lead to a shortage of desirable apartments? have an easier time finding vacant apartments. Instead of spending time and money searching for apartments and then having to accept an apartment in a poorly maintained building, many renters would be able to find a wider selection of apartments. Landlords would also have a greater incentive to properly maintain their buildings and invest in new construction. On the other hand, once rent control is ended, people living in formerly rent-controlled apartments may no longer be able to afford the higher rents. As soon as the neighborhood improves, these renters may be priced out of their apartments and replaced by people willing to pay the equilibrium price. Certainly, the end of rent control benefits some people and hurts others. Nearly all economists agree that the benefits of ending rent control exceed the costs, and suggest that there are better ways to help poor households find affordable housing. SUMMARIzE What is one positive and one negative effect of government intervention in the rental market in the form of price ceilings? Price Floors A price floor is a minimum price, set by government, that must be paid for a good or service. Governments set price floors to ensure that certain sellers receive at least a minimum reward for their efforts. Sellers can include workers, who sell their labor. The Minimum Wage One well-known price floor is the minimum wage, which sets a minimum price employers can pay for one hour of labor. (The federal government sets a minimum wage, but states can make theirs higher.) A full-time worker paid the federal minimum wage will earn less than government says is necessary to support a couple with one child. Still, the minimum wage does ensure a lower limit for workers&apos; earnings. But do the benefits of a minimum wage outweigh the loss of some jobs? The supply and demand curves for labor are combined in Figure 3.21. This theoretical supply curve shows the workers available at various wage rates. The demand curve shows the workers employers will hire at various wages. (In this example, the worker is the supplier of labor purchased by an employer.) If the minimum wage is set above the market equilibrium wage rate, the demand for workers will go down. 3.7 Equilibrium and Price Controls 119 ]]></text>

Analyze Graphs In this graph, what happens to the supply of labor with a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour? If the equilibrium wage for low-skilled labor is $6.60 per hour, and the minimum wage is set at $7.25, the result is a surplus of labor. Firms will employ 2 million fewer low-skilled workers than they would at the equilibrium wage rate, because the price floor keeps the wage rate artificially high. If the minimum wage is below the equilibrium rate, it will have no effect, because employers would have to pay the equilibrium rate anyway to find workers in a free market. Remember, Figure 3.21 is a theoretical model of the effects of a minimum wage. The real world is more complex, and some economists believe the actual effect of the minimum wage on employment rates is not as severe as in this example. Agricultural Price Supports Agricultural price supports are another example of price floors used for farm products. Like the minimum wage, price supports have supporters and opponents. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government began setting minimum prices for many commodities. Unlike the minimum wage, these price floors were not legal minimums set for buyers. Instead, whenever prices fell below a certain level, the government created demand by buying excess crops. Supporters of price floors believed they were necessary because American farms would not easily survive in a freely competitive market. If many American farms were to go out of business, the United States would have to depend on other nations for food. Opponents of price supports argued that the regulations were a burden to farmers. Government dictated what and how much farmers should produce. Congress voted to phase out most of these programs in 1996 because they seemed to conflict with free market principles. Some people worried that without government stepping in to buy excess crops, farmers would overproduce. One farmer commented: When you have bumper crops, if it truly is a supply-and-demand market, and you&apos;re supplying more than what the demand is, it&apos;s financial suicide. &ndash;Brian Romsdahl, Minnesota Public Radio, 1998 Despite efforts to end price supports, many commodities remain relatively untouched by the new laws. For example, government has periodically bought surplus milk to help keep the price from dropping below the set minimum. In addition, government often responds to low prices by providing emergency financial aid to farmers. dEfINE Why is the minimum wage considered to be a price floor? ASSESSMENT 1.

Sometimes prices go up, and sometimes prices go down. But either way, the principle of market equilibrium is at work. As you will see, changes in supply and demand affect a variety of products, from digital cameras to toys. Economists say that a market will tend toward equilibrium, which means that the price and quantity will gradually move toward their equilibrium levels. Why does this happen? Remember that a shortage will cause firms to raise prices. Higher prices cause the quantity supplied to rise and the quantity demanded to fall until the two values are equal. On the other hand, a surplus will force firms to cut prices. Falling prices cause quantity demanded to rise and quantity supplied to fall until, once again, they are equal. Through these relationships, the market price of a good and the quantity supplied will move toward their equilibrium values.

IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS What changes can push a market out of equilibrium? Increasing Supply You have learned about the different non-price determinants that can shift a supply curve to the left or to the right&ndash;that is, decrease or increase supply of a good or service in the marketplace. These factors include advances in technology, new government taxes and subsidies, and changes in the prices of the raw materials and labor used to produce the good or service. You know that market equilibrium occurs at the intersection of a demand curve and a supply curve. This means that a shift of the entire supply curve will change the quantity supplied and demanded and the equilibrium price. In other words, a shift in the supply curve to the left or the right creates a new equilibrium point. Markets tend toward equilibrium, so a change in supply will set into motion market >> Early digital cameras combined high prices with low- quality. Predict Consequences What do you think will happen to the supply curve for digital cameras as technology improves? forces that lead the market to a new equilibrium price and quantity sold. To illustrate these market forces, we will present an example of what happens when supply shifts to the right. We will look at a familiar product that has undergone a radical market change in a relatively short period of time: the digital camera. Market Changes Digital cameras were first introduced into the consumer market in 1994. These early digital cameras were far less sophisticated than the ones that people use today. They produced grainy pictures of lower quality than cameras that used film. The first digital cameras were also expensive, at a cost of well over $700 each. Gradually, improved technology for producing digital cameras caused prices to fall. By 2000, a consumer could purchase a midrange digital camera for $500; just two years later, a similar camera cost about $350. Today, a camera like the one that cost over $700 in 1994 would sell for well under $100. Consumers have their pick of many models at a low cost. At the same time, the quality of digital cameras has improved. For a fraction of that original $700 cost, you can now get a digital camera that has many more features and produces far better photographs than the first digital cameras. In fact, many smartphones today contain cameras that exceed the quality of the early, expensive devices. Why has this happened? Advances in technology have lowered the cost of manufacturing digital cameras by reducing some of the input costs, such as computer chips. Advances in production have allowed manufacturers to produce digital cameras at lower costs. These lower costs have been passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. We can use the graphing tools developed in an earlier lesson to show the effect of these changes on the digital camera market&apos;s supply curve. As shown in Figure 3.22, the supply curve shifted to the right as manufacturers continued to offer a greater supply of digital cameras at lower prices. In 2000, no digital cameras were offered for $100. They were simply too expensive to develop and manufacture. Today, manufacturers can offer millions of cameras at this price and still make a profit. Finding a New Equilibrium Digital cameras evolved from an expensive luxury good to a midrange good when a new generation of computer chips reduced the cost of production. These lower costs shifted the supply curve to the right, where, at 122 TOPIC 3 Demand, Supply, and Prices ]]></text>

Draw Conclusions Why do you think the pace of the falling prices began to slow in 2004? each price, producers are willing to supply a larger quantity. A graph can show you how the shifts in supply threw the market into disequilibrium. Figure 3.23 represents what happens in this situation. (The numbers used here are fictional to help provide a clear representation of the market forces.) After the shift, suppliers were willing to offer 4,000,000 cameras per year at the original equilibrium price of 2,000,000. In Figure 3.23, the increase in quantity supplied at the original equilibrium price is shown as the change from point a to point b. However, the quantity demanded at this price has not changed, and consumers will buy only 2,000,000 digital cameras. If this original equilibrium price is not changed, unsold digital cameras&ndash;or inventory, the quantity of goods that a firm has on hand&ndash;will begin to pile up in the warehouse. When quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded at a given price, there is a surplus. Something will have to change to bring the market to equilibrium. As you know, suppliers will respond to a surplus by reducing prices. As the price falls from $900 to $450, more consumers buy digital cameras, and the quantity demanded rises. The combined movement of falling prices and increasing quantity demanded can be seen in Figure 3.23 as a change from point a to point c. Notice that this change is a movement along the demand curve, not a shift of the entire demand curve. At point c, the price has fallen to a level where quantity supplied and quantity demanded are equal. Surplus is no longer a problem. This new equilibrium point marks a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity supplied than before the supply curve shifted. This is how equilibrium changes when supply increases, and the entire supply curve shifts to the right. Changing Equilibrium As improved technology caused the price of digital cameras to fall, sales increased. Market equilibrium then started moving gradually downward and to the right, where the quantities demanded and supplied are higher and prices are lower. The supply curve for digital cameras has been moving to the right ever since the first cameras were sold. The curve continues to shift today as new technology drives down the production cost and market price of the most basic cameras. In real-life markets, equilibrium is usually not an unchanging, single point on a graph. The equilibrium in the digital camera market has always been in motion. The market equilibrium follows the intersection of the demand curve and the supply 3.8 Changes in Market Equilibrium 123 ]]></text>

Manufacturers and retail sellers of digital cameras are constantly searching for a new equilibrium as technology and methods of production change. Consumers can easily recognize the impact of this search by the frequent price changes, sales, and rebates for digital cameras. Each of these tactics is designed to keep older cameras moving out of stores as fast as new cameras come in. ChECK UNdERSTANdING What happens to the equilibrium price when the supply curve shifts to the right? Decreasing Supply New technology or lower costs can shift the supply curve to the right. However, other factors that reduce supply can shift the supply curve to the left. Any change in supply changes the equilibrium point. Consider the market for cars. If the price of steel or rubber rises, automobile manufacturers will produce fewer cars at all price levels, and the supply curve will shift to the left. If auto workers win higher wages, and the company must pay more for labor to build the same number of cars, supply will decrease.

In all of these cases, the supply curve will move to the left, because the quantity supplied is lower at all price levels. When the supply curve shifts to the left, the equilibrium price and quantity sold will change as well. This process is the exact opposite of the change that results from an increase in supply. As the supply curve shifts to the left, suppliers raise their prices, and the quantity demanded falls. The new equilibrium point will be at a spot along the demand curve above and to the left of the original equilibrium point. The market price is higher than before, and the quantity sold is lower. ChECK UNdERSTANdING What happens to price and quantity demanded when the supply curve shifts to the left? Increasing Demand Almost every year, we experience a new fad&ndash;a product that enjoys enormous popularity for a fairly short time. Around November, a new doll, toy, or video game emerges as the “must-buy” item of the season. Holiday shoppers across the country stand in long lines, waiting for stores to open, just to obtain that year&apos;s version of Tickle Me Elmo or Webkinz&reg;. You know that fads reflect the impact of consumer tastes and advertising on consumer behavior. Fads like these, in which demand rises quickly, are real- life examples of a rapid, rightward shift in a market demand curve. Figure 3.24 shows how a swift, unexpected increase in market demand can affect the equilibrium in a market for a hypothetical, trendy new toy. Shortages Figure 3.24 shows how the fad causes a sudden increase in market demand and a shift of the demand curve to the right. This shift reflects a shortage at the original price of $24 (point b). Before the fad began, quantity demanded and quantity supplied were equal at 300,000 toys (point a). On the graph, the shortage appears as a gap at the $24 price level between the quantity supplied of 300,000 toys and the new quantity demanded of 500,000 toys, shown at point b. The fad has caused the quantity demanded to increase by 200,000. In the stores that carry the toy, the shortage appears as empty shelves or long lines. Shortage also appears in the form of search costs&ndash;the financial and opportunity costs that consumers pay in searching for a product or service. Driving to or calling different stores to find an available toy are examples of search costs. Today, the Internet has ]]></text>

In the meantime, the available toys must be distributed in some other manner. In this case, long lines, limits on the quantities each customer may buy, and “first come, first serve” policies are used to distribute a limited number of toys among customers. Return to Equilibrium In time, firms will react to the signs of shortage by increasing their prices and the quantity supplied. Customers may actually push prices up on their own if there is “bidding” in the market, as there is for real estate, antiques, fine art, and rare items. For example, if parents cannot find the toy they want at the store, they might offer the storekeeper an extra $10 to guarantee getting a toy from the next shipment. Through methods like this, the market price will rise until the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at 400,000 toys. All of these toys are sold at the new equilibrium price of $30, shown at point c in Figure 3.24. When demand increases, both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity also increase. The demand curve has shifted, and the equilibrium point has moved, setting in motion market forces that push the price and quantity toward their new equilibrium values. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS How is equilibrium restored after a shortage? Decreasing Demand When a fad passes its peak, demand can fall as quickly as it rose. The shortage turns into a surplus for the once-popular toy, as parents look for new, trendier gifts for their children. Overflowing store shelves and silent cash registers, the symptoms of a surplus, replace long lines and policies that limit purchases. As demand falls, the demand curve shifts to the left. Suppliers will respond to decreased demand for the once-fashionable toy by cutting prices on their inventory. Price and quantity supplied slide down to the equilibrium point shown at point a in Figure 3.24. The end of the fad has restored the original price and quantity supplied. New technology can also lead to a decrease in consumer demand. Digital camera sales captured just 18 percent of the market in 2000. But in 2012, digital camera sales accounted for 99 percent of the market. Digital technology has led to a steep decline in film camera sales.

A discount shoe store offers low-end sneakers for $20. At other stores, you find that you can spend as little as $50 for brand- name sneakers, or more than $200 for a pair of designer basketball shoes. Basing your decision on the available supply, the price, and your demand, you buy the $50 sneakers. Later, through online research, you find a pair of sneakers similar to the pair you bought, on sale for $5 less, including shipping. You buy the online sneakers with your credit card and return the sneakers you bought at the mall. Prices in a Free Market In a free market economy, prices offer a number of advantages to both consumers and producers. Simple purchases would be much more complicated and inefficient without the price system to help us make informed decisions. In this lesson, you will see how prices affect consumer behavior and how producers respond. You will also see how profits act as an incentive.

Price changes can move markets toward equilibrium and solve problems of shortage and surplus. In a free market, prices are a tool for distributing goods and resources throughout the economy. Prices are nearly always the most efficient way to allocate, or distribute, resources. Prices help move land, labor, and capital into the hands of producers and finished goods into the hands of buyers. The alternative method for distributing goods and resources, namely a centrally planned economy, is not nearly as efficient as a market system based on prices. As you will see, prices play other vital roles in a free market economy. Prices serve as a language, as an incentive, and as a signal of economic conditions. The price system is flexible and free, and it allows for a wide diversity of goods and services. LIST three roles that prices play in a free market system.

Analyze Graphs Which problem is price solving in this graph? Explain, using the points on the graph. The Benefits of the Price System Prices provide a common language for buyers and sellers. Could you conceive of a marketplace without prices? Without prices as a standard measure of value, a seller would have to barter&ndash;that is, exchange one type of good or service for another. Under a barter system, one customer might offer two pairs of shoes in exchange for one sweater, but another customer might be willing to trade three pairs of shoes for the same sweater. The supplier would have no consistent and accurate way to measure demand for a product. Such a system would be inconvenient, impractical, and inefficient. Prices Provide Incentives Buyers and sellers alike look at prices to find information on a good&apos;s demand and supply. The laws of supply and demand describe how people and firms respond to a change in prices. In these cases, prices are signals that tell producers or consumers how to adjust. Prices communicate to buyers and to sellers whether goods are in short supply or readily available. In the example of the “fad” toy discussed in the preceding lesson, the sudden increase in demand for the toy told suppliers that people wanted more of those toys, and soon! However, the signal that producers respond to is not simply the demand but also the high price consumers are willing to pay for the toy, well above the usual retail price. This higher price tells firms not only that people want more of the toys, but also that the firms can earn more profit by producing more toys, because they are in demand. Therefore, rising prices in a market will provide an incentive for existing firms to produce more of the goods that are in demand and will encourage new firms to enter a market. Prices Serve as Signals Think of prices as a traffic light. A green light means “go,” and a red light means “stop.” A relatively high price is a green light that tells producers that a specific product is in demand and that they should use their resources to produce more. New suppliers will also join the market. But a low price is a red light to producers, signaling that a good is being overproduced. In this case, low prices tell a supplier that he or she might earn higher profits by using existing resources to produce a different product. For consumers, a low price is a green light to buy more of a product. A low price indicates that the product carries a low opportunity cost for the consumer and offers a chance to get a good deal.

Explain How can the price system do all of this and still be “free”? Bounce to Activate Chart the same token, a high price is a red light that tells consumers to stop and think carefully before buying. Prices Are Responsive and Flexible Another important aspect of prices is that they are responsive to market conditions. When a supply shift or a demand shift changes the equilibrium in a market, price and quantity supplied need to change to solve problems of too much or too little demand. In many markets, prices are much more flexible than output levels. Prices can easily be increased to solve a problem of shortage, and they can just as easily be decreased to eliminate a problem of surplus. For example, a supply shock is a sudden shortage of a good such as gasoline or wheat. A supply shock creates a shortage because suppliers can no longer meet consumer demand. The immediate problem is how to divide up the available supply among consumers. What are the options? Increasing supply can be a time-consuming and difficult process. For example, wheat takes time to plant, grow, and harvest. Rationing, a system of allocating goods and services using criteria other than price, is expensive and can take a long time to organize. Rationing is the basis of central planning, an economic system in which a central authority, rather than a free market, makes basic economic decisions for a society. Rationing has also been used at times in U.S. history. Raising prices is the quickest way to resolve a shortage. A quick increase in prices can reduce quantity demanded to the same level as quantity supplied and avoid the problem of distribution. The people who have enough money and value the product most highly will pay the most for it. These consumers will be the only consumers still in the market at the higher price, and the market will settle at a new equilibrium. The Price System Is “Free” A free market distribution system, based on prices, costs nothing to administer. Central planning, however, requires many administrators to collect information on production and decide how resources are to be distributed. In the former Soviet Union, the government employed thousands of bureaucrats in an enormous agency called GOSPLAN to organize the economy. During World War II, the United States government set up a similar agency, called the Office of Price Administration, to prevent inflation and coordinate the rationing of important goods. The price system has many benefits. Unlike central planning, free market pricing distributes goods through millions of decisions made daily by consumers and suppliers.

A farmer looks at prices listed in crop reports and decides whether to grow corn instead of soybeans next year. Everyone is familiar with how prices work and knows how to use them. Consumers are also free to react to prices. Displaying a price one cent below the next full dollar amount often makes people feel like the price is significantly lower than if it was listed at the round dollar amount ($2.99 appears less expensive than $3.00 to people). This way of displaying the price may influence consumers to consider buying something they wouldn&apos;t consider at the higher price. In short, prices help goods flow through the economy without a central plan. IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS How does the price system provide incentives for producers and for consumers? Choice and Efficiency One benefit of a market-based economy is the diversity of goods and services that consumers can buy. Prices help consumers choose among similar products. You could have bought footwear along a >>In a market-based economy, consumers have a diversity of goods and services available to them. Consumers use prices to help them make choices among similar goods and services. wide range of prices, from the cheap $20 pair to the $200 designer basketball shoes. Based on your income, you decided on a pair of sneakers at the lower end of the price range. The prices provided an easy way for you to narrow your choices to a certain price range. Prices also allow producers to target the audience they want with the products that will sell best to that audience. Another benefit of the U.S. free enterprise system is responsive prices. That is, prices go up or down in response to consumer demand. In a command economy, however, one organization decides what goods are produced and how much stores will charge for those goods. To limit their costs, central planners restrict production to a few varieties of each product. As a result, consumers in the former Communist states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union had far fewer choices of goods than consumers in Western Europe and the United States. The government of the Soviet Union built whole neighborhoods of identical apartment blocks and supermarkets with names such as “Supermarket No. 3.” Rationing and Shortages Although goods in the Soviet Union were inexpensive, consumers could not always find them. When they did, they often had to wait hours for eggs or soap, and years for apartments or telephones. The United States experienced similar, although far less severe, problems when the federal government instituted temporary price controls during World War II. The needs of the U.S. armed forces for food, metal, and rubber during World War II created tremendous shortages at home. To ensure that resources were available for military use, the government controlled the distribution of food and goods. Rationing in the United States was only a short- term hardship. Choices were limited, and consumers felt that some people fared better than others. However, rationing was chosen because a price- based system might have put food and housing out of the reach of some Americans, and the government wanted to guarantee every civilian a minimum standard of living during wartime. The Black Market The federal government was unable to control the supply of all goods passing through the economy. A butcher could sell a steak without asking for ration points, or a landlord might be willing to rent an apartment at the rate fixed by the government only if the renter threw in a cash “bonus” or an extra two months&apos; rent as a “deposit.” When people conduct business without regard for government controls on price or quantity, they Bounce to Activate Gallery 130 TOPIC 3 Demand, Supply, and Prices ]]></text>

Black markets allow consumers to pay more so they can buy a product when rationing makes it otherwise unavailable. Although black markets are a nearly inevitable consequence of rationing, such trade is illegal and strongly discouraged by governments. Efficient Resource Allocation All of the advantages of a free market allow prices to allocate, or distribute, resources efficiently. Efficient resource allocation means that economic resources&ndash;land, labor, and capital&ndash;will be used for their most valuable purposes. A market system, with its responsive prices, ensures that resources go to the uses that consumers value most highly. A price- based system also ensures that resource use will adjust relatively quickly to the changing demands of consumers. These changes take place without any central control, because the people who own resources&ndash; landowners, workers who sell their labor, and people who provide capital to firms&ndash;seek the largest possible returns. How do people earn the largest returns? They sell their resources to the highest bidder. The highest bidder will be that firm that produces goods that are in the highest demand. Therefore, the resources will flow to the uses that are most highly valued by consumers. This flow is the most efficient way to use our society&apos;s scarce resources in a way that benefits both producers and consumers. IdENTIfy SUPPORTING dETAILS How does the practice of rationing address a shortage of goods? Prices and the Profit Incentive In a free market, efficient resource allocation goes hand in hand with the profit incentive. Suppose that scientists predicted extremely hot weather for the coming summer. In most parts of the country, consumers would buy up air conditioners and fans to prepare for the heat. Power companies would buy reserves of oil and natural gas to supply these appliances with enough power. Since demand would exceed supply, consumers would bid up the price of fans, and power plants would bid up the price of fuel. Suppliers would recognize the possibility for profit in the higher prices charged for these goods, and they would produce more fans and air conditioners. Oil and natural gas fields would hire workers to >> Waste is a negative externality of some manufacturing. Analyze Political Cartoons Who is the “someone else” who has taken on the cost of cleaning up toxic waste? produce more fuel for power plants. Eventually, more fans, air conditioners, and fuel would move into the market. The potential heat wave would have created a need among consumers for certain goods, and the rise in prices would have given producers an incentive to meet this need. As we previously noted, efficient resource allocation occurs naturally in a market system as long as the system works reasonably well. Landowners tend to use their scarce property in the most profitable manner. Workers usually move toward higher-paying jobs, and capital will be invested in the firms that pay the highest returns. The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith wrote about the profit incentive in The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Smith explained that it is not because of charity that the baker and the butcher provide people with food. Rather, they provide bread and meat because prices are such that they profit from doing so. In other words, businesses prosper by finding out what people want and then providing it. Smith&apos;s observations have been highly influential, and the system he championed has proved to be more efficient than any other that has been tried in the modern era. Market Problems There are some exceptions to the idea that markets lead to an efficient allocation of resources. One problem is imperfect competition: If only a few firms are selling a product, there might not be enough competition to lower market prices to the true equilibrium point. If there is only one producer in a market, he or she will usually charge a higher 3.9 Prices at Work 131 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="198"> <text><![CDATA[ price than we would see in a market with competing businesses. A second problem involves negative externalities. These are side effects of production that impose unintended costs. Examples of negative externalities include air and water pollution. Negative externalities affect people who have no control over how much of a product is produced or consumed. Since producers do not have to pay these unintended costs, their total costs seem artificially low, and they will produce more than the equilibrium quantity of the good. The extra costs will be paid by consumers or, in some cases, by society at large. Imperfect information is a third problem that can prevent markets from operating smoothly. If buyers and sellers do not have enough information, they may not make the choice that is best for them.

Lesson 1: Fundamentals of Demand LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.4 Demand is the desire to own something and the ability to pay for it. Demand for a product depends on potential buyers&apos; income and the availability of substitutes. The quantity demanded for a given product depends on its price. Demand schedules and demand curves show the relationship between price and demand. Lesson 2: Shifts in Demand LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.4 Demand for a product can shift due to changes in income, consumer tastes and expectations, population size, or population characeristics. Demand can also shift due to changes in the price or availability of substitutes or complements. Lesson 3: Elasticity of Demand LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.4 Elasticity is the sensitivity of demand to price. When demand is inelastic, or insensitive to price, producers can maximize earnings by raising prices, but not if demand is elastic, or sensitive. Elasticity depends on the availability of substitutes and whether a product is a necessity or a luxury. Lesson 4: Fundamentals of Supply SS.912.E.1.4 Supply is the amount of a good or service that is available. The quantity supplied depends on price. Supply tends to be inelastic at first, as suppliers cannot increase capacity quickly, but become elastic over time. Lesson 5: Costs of Production SS.912.E.1.7 Decisions how much to produce depend on marginal cost&ndash;the cost of adding one more unit&ndash;and on marginal revenue&ndash;the amount earned from adding one unit. Lesson 6: Changes in Supply SS.912.E.1.4 Supply responds to changes in cost. If costs fall, supply will rise; if prices rise, supply will fall. Supply depends on the costs of factors of production, such as labor. It is affected by technology and responds to government actions and expected changes in demand and price. Lesson 7: Equilibrium and Price Controls LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.4 Equilibrium is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. Price controls such as rent control or minimum wages, when prices are set above or below equilibrium, can create problems of excess supply or demand. Lesson 8: Changes in Market Equilibrium SS.912.E.1.4 Changes in supply or demand change the equilibrium price of a product. If demand rises or supply falls, the price will find a new, higher equilibrium level. If demand falls or supply rises, the equilibrium price will fall. Lesson 9: Prices at Work LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.4 Prices are an efficient tool for allocating resources. They help buyers and sellers make decisions. They help balance supply with demand. The price system is flexible and operates free of cost. Prices may not function efficiently to deal with externalities, imperfect competition, or supply shocks affecting essential goods. ]]></text>

List two common barriers that prevent firms from entering a market. Describe prices and output in a perfectly competitive market. >> Key Terms pure competition commodity barrier to entry imperfect competition start-up costs Pure Competition Conditions for Pure Competition A market has a few basic elements. Producers supply goods and services. Consumers demand goods and services to satisfy their wants and needs. The interaction of supply and demand sets price. That interaction often features another key component of a market system: competition. Competition is, quite simply, the effort of each supplier to be the one who meets the demand of as many consumers as possible. The farmer&apos;s market, with its identical goods and many buyers and sellers, is a rare, real-world example of a market in pure competition. Pure competition, also called perfect competition, is the simplest market structure. A market with pure competition is one in which a large number of firms all produce essentially the same product. In pure competition, the market is in equilibrium, and all firms sell the same product for the same price. However, each firm produces so little of that product compared with the total supply that no single firm can hope to influence price. The only decision such producers can make is how much to produce, given their production costs and the market price. While few industries meet all the conditions for pure competition, some come close. Examples include markets for many farm products and the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

    <page pageNumber="209"> <text><![CDATA[ These examples fulfill the four strict conditions for a market with pure competition: &bull; Many buyers and sellers participate in the market. &bull; Sellers offer identical products. &bull; Buyers and sellers are well informed about products. &bull; Sellers are able to enter and exit the market easily. Many Buyers and Sellers Markets with pure competition require many participants on both the buying and the selling sides. This condition leads to an important feature of purely competitive markets&ndash; the inability of any buyer or seller to control price. No individual can be powerful enough to buy or sell enough goods to influence the total market quantity or the market price. Everyone in the market must accept the market price as given. As you have read, supply and demand interact to determine both price and output. If a market has many independent buyers and sellers, it is not very likely that large enough groups of either buyers or sellers will work together to bargain for better prices. Instead, the market determines price as a result of the total supply and demand of all individual suppliers and consumers. Any given individual supplier or consumer has no more influence on price than any other supplier or consumer. Identical Products In a purely competitive market, there are no differences between the products sold by different suppliers. This is the second condition for pure competition. If a rancher needs to buy corn to feed his cattle, he will not care which farmer grew the corn, as long as every farm is willing to deliver the corn he needs for the same price. If an investor buys a share of a company&apos;s stock, she will not care which particular share she is buying. A product that is considered the same regardless of who makes or sells it is called a commodity. Examples of commodities include low-grade gasoline, notebook paper, sugar, and silicon chips. Identical products are a key to pure competition for one reason: the buyer will not pay extra for one particular company&apos;s goods. The buyer will always choose the supplier with the lowest price. Informed Buyers and Sellers The third condition for a purely competitive market is that buyers and sellers know enough about the market to find the best deal. Under conditions of pure competition, the market provides the buyer with full information about the features of the product and its price.

Bounce to Activate Chart the market to work effectively, both buyers and sellers have clear incentives to gather as much information as possible. In most markets, a buyer&apos;s willingness to find information about prices and availability represents a trade-off. The time spent gathering information must be worth the amount of money that will be saved. For example, most buyers would not search the Internet or visit a dozen convenience stores to save five cents on a pack of chewing gum. Easy Market Entry and Exit The final condition of a purely competitive market is that firms must be able to enter it when they can make money and leave it when they can&apos;t earn enough to stay in business. For example, if a new farmer&apos;s market opened in a town, a farmer or other vendor would probably not have much trouble setting up a spot to sell her goods. If that vendor was unable to make much money at the market, however, she could just as easily decide to leave it. Studies show that markets with more firms, and thus more competition, have lower prices. When one firm can keep others out of the market, it can sell its product at a higher price. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS What controls price in a market with pure competition? Barriers to Entry and Competition Factors that make it difficult for new firms to enter a market are called barriers to entry. Barriers to entry can lead to imperfect competition, a market structure that fails to meet the conditions of pure competition. Common barriers to entry include startup costs and technology. High Start-Up Costs When launching a new firm, entrepreneurs need to invest money long before they can start earning income. Before a new sandwich shop can open, the owner needs to rent a store; buy a refrigerator, a freezer, and an oven; and print menus. The expenses that a new business must pay before it can begin to produce and sell goods are called startup costs. When the start-up costs in a market are high, entrepreneurs are less likely to enter that market. As a result, markets that involve high start-up costs are less likely to be purely competitive markets. For example, the start-up costs for a lumber mill or a supermarket are much higher than those for 144 TOPIC 4 Competition and Market Structures ]]></text>

Use of the Internet reduced start-up costs in many markets, including books and music. However, many entrepreneurs discovered that a Web page did not attract and hold customers as easily as a shop window. The high costs of advertising, shipping, and discounting goods pushed many out of business. With a few exceptions, the Internet-based companies that have succeeded paid substantial start-up costs. Complex Technology When a school group needs to raise money, its members can sell cookies or candy. Some technically skilled students might offer to fix cars or bicycles. But very few student groups would be able to raise money by creating and selling a new computer word-processing program. Some markets require a high degree of technological know-how&ndash;the knowledge and skills needed to create or repair something. A carpenter, pharmacist, or electrician can spend years in training before he or she has learned all the necessary skills. Computer software engineers need extensive training to develop, create, and customize computer software and manage computer network systems. As a result, new entrepreneurs cannot easily enter these markets without a lot of preparation and study. Technological barriers to entry can keep a market from becoming purely competitive. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS Give an example of a business with high start-up costs and one with low start-up costs. Price, Output, and Purely Competitive Markets One of the primary characteristics of purely competitive markets is that they are efficient. Competition within these markets keeps both prices and production costs low. Firms must use all inputs&ndash;land, labor, organizational skills, machinery and equipment&ndash;to their best advantage. As a result, the prices that consumers pay and the revenue that suppliers receive accurately reflect how much the market values the inputs used to produce the product. In a purely competitive market, prices correctly represent the opportunity costs of each product. Market Equilibrium in Pure Competition Demand Supply Price Quantity Equilibrium price Equilibrium quantity >> Figure 4.1 Under pure competition, supply and demand set the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity. Analyze Information Would the entry of a new firm change the equilibrium price? Why or why not? Prices in a purely competitive market are the lowest sustainable prices possible. Because many sellers compete to offer their commodities to buyers, intense competition forces prices down to the point where the prices just cover the most efficient sellers&apos; costs of doing business. As you have learned, this equilibrium is usually the most efficient state a market can achieve. Equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market is shown in Figure 4.1. Producers generally earn their highest profits when they produce enough that their cost to produce one more unit exactly equals the market price of the unit. Since no supplier can influence prices in purely competitive markets, producers will make their output decisions based on their most efficient use of available land, labor, capital, and management skills. In the long run, output in a purely competitive market will reach the point where each supplying firm just covers all of its costs and earns only the minimally acceptable profit. This outcome is not very desirable from the point of view of the owners, however. COMPARE POINTS Of VIEw Who likes a purely competitive market more, consumers or producers?

Explain why monopolists sometimes practice price discrimination. >> Key Terms monopoly economies of scale natural monopoly government monopoly patent franchise license price discrimination market power Characteristics of a Monopoly While there are different types of monopolies, all are characterized by a single seller that controls an entire market. This arrangement allows monopolies to control output and charge higher prices. A monopoly forms when barriers prevent firms from entering a market that has a single supplier. While a purely competitive market has many buyers and sellers, monopoly markets have only one seller but any number of buyers. In fact, barriers to entry are the principal condition that allows monopolies to exist. Economists use a strict set of requirements to characterize a monopoly. Besides having a single seller and barriers to entry, a monopoly is also characterized by supplying a unique product. But suppliers may only appear to have a unique product, because if we take a broader view, we may uncover alternatives. For example, you might think that a convenience store on a highway in the middle of the desert has a monopoly. However, travelers can carry their own supplies in their car instead of paying high prices for items at the store. Or, if they have enough money, they can take an airplane across the desert and bypass the store altogether. In other words, there are options. In a monopoly, the good or service provided has no close substitute. The problem with monopolies is that they can take advantage of their market power and charge high prices.

For this reason, the United States has outlawed some monopolistic practices. Economies of Scale All monopolies have one trait in common: a single seller in a market. However, different market conditions can create different types of monopolies. If a firm&apos;s start-up costs are high, and its average costs fall for each additional unit it produces, then it enjoys what economists call economies of scale. Economies of scale are characteristics that cause a producer&apos;s average cost to drop as production rises. Figure 4.2 shows an average total cost curve for a firm without economies of scale. Follow the curve from left to right. As output increases from zero, the average cost of each good drops, and the curve initially slopes downward. This is because large, initial, fixed costs, like the cost of the factory and machinery, can be spread out among more and more goods as production rises. If the factory cost $1,000 to build and each unit of output costs $10 to make, producing one unit will cost $1,010, but producing two units will cost $1,020, or only $510 each. However, if the industry has limited economies of scale, output will eventually rise to a level at which the limited-scale economies are exhausted, and the cost of making each unit will rise. The average Effect of Economies of Scale cost of producing each good increases as output increases, and the curve slopes upward to match the rising cost per unit. A factory in an industry with economies of scale never reaches this second stage of rising costs per unit. As production increases, the firm becomes more efficient, even at a level of output high enough to supply the entire market. Figure 4.2 shows how cost and output are related in economies of scale. Follow the curve from left to right. As output increases, the cost per unit falls, and continues to fall. A good example is a hydroelectric plant, which generates electricity from a dam on a river. A large dam is expensive to build. However, once the dam is built, the plant can produce energy at a very low additional cost simply by letting water flow through the dam. The average cost of the first unit of electricity produced is very high because the cost of the dam is so high. As output increases, the fixed costs of the dam can be spread over more units of electricity, so the average cost drops. In a market with economies of scale, bigger is better. An industry that enjoys economies of scale can easily become a natural monopoly. However, new strategies are emerging. Some business leaders now favor sidestepping economies of scale: Averagetotalcost Averagetotalcost Cost Output Cost Output Average Total Cost Curve Without Economies of Scale Average Total Cost Curve With Economies of Scale The average cost rises when output exceeds a certain level. With economies of scale, the average cost of production falls when the firm produces more. >> Figure 4.2 With economies of scale, production costs continue to fall as output increases.

    <page pageNumber="215"> <text><![CDATA[ Many business leaders are reexamining their assumptions about the benefits of scale. Scaling down, not up, and building “disposable factories” and even “disposable strategies” are becoming new keys to lowering costs and boosting performance. &ndash;George Stalk, 5 Future Strategies You Need Right Now, Harvard Business School Press, 2008 Natural Monopolies A natural monopoly is a market that runs most efficiently when one large firm provides all of the output. If a second firm enters the market, competition will drive down the market price charged to customers and decrease the quantity each firm can sell. One or both of the firms will not be able to cover their costs and will go out of business. Public water provides a good example of a natural monopoly. In a competitive market, different water companies would invest huge amounts of money to dig reservoirs and set up overlapping networks of pipes and pumping stations to deliver water to the same town. Companies would use more land and water than necessary. Each company would have to pay for all of the unneeded pipes and would serve customers no better than a single network. In cases like this, the government often steps in to allow just one firm in each geographic area to provide these necessary services. The government action ensures that resources are not wasted by building additional plants when only one is needed. In return for monopoly status, a firm with a natural monopoly agrees to let government control the prices it can charge and what services it must provide. Technology and Change Sometimes the development of a new technology can destroy a natural monopoly. A new innovation can cut fixed costs and make small companies as efficient as one large firm. When telephone calls were carried by thick copper wires, local telephone service was considered a natural monopoly. No one wanted to build more than one network of wires to connect thousands of homes and businesses. In the 1990s, more and more consumers began using cellular phones, which are portable and can carry phone calls via radio waves rather than through wires. Cellular technology reduced the barriers to entry in the local telephone market. >> Mass transit systems such as subways, commuter rails, and buses are examples of natural monopolies, which are often regulated by the government. Bounce to Activate Gallery Now that cellular phone companies can link to thousands or millions of customers with a few well-placed towers, they don&apos;t need to invest in an expensive infrastructure of cables and telephone poles. Cellular phone companies have become as efficient as traditional wire-based phone services. In addition, Internet phone service, which sends phone calls over the Internet, is another technological innovation that has changed the telephone industry. dETERMINE CENTRAL IdEAS What is one characteristic all types of monopolies have in common? The Role of Government In the case of a natural monopoly, the government allows the monopoly to form and then regulates it. In other cases, however, government actions themselves can create barriers to entry in markets and thereby create monopolies. A government monopoly is a monopoly created by the government. Technological Monopolies One way that the government can give a company monopoly power 4.2 Monopolies 149 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="216"> <text><![CDATA[ is by issuing a patent. A patent gives a company exclusive rights to sell a new good or service for a specific period of time. Suppose that Leland Pharmaceuticals developed a new, effective asthma medication called BreatheDeep that helped people with asthma to breathe more easily. If Leland&apos;s researchers could prove to the government that they had invented BreatheDeep, the government would grant Leland a patent. This patent would give Leland the exclusive right to sell BreatheDeep for 20 years. Why would the government want to give a company monopoly power? Patents guarantee that companies can profit from their own research without competition. For this reason, patents encourage firms to research and develop new products that benefit society as a whole, even though the research and development costs may be very high. The patent allows firms to set prices that maximize their opportunity to make a profit. By protecting patent rights, the government encourages innovations in industries such as pharmaceuticals, where a number of new drugs have been developed to treat different types of cancer and other diseases. Franchises and Licenses A franchise is a contract issued by a local authority that gives a single firm the right to sell its goods within an exclusive market. National companies often grant franchises to entrepreneurs, who then sell that company&apos;s product in a local market. Important Patents in U.S. History 20001950 1900185018001750 1876 Alexander Graham Bell patents the telephone. 1880 Thomas Edison perfects and patents the incandescent light bulb. 1903 Mary Anderson patents windshield wipers for cars. 1794 Eli Whitney patents the cotton gin. 2008 Apple granted early iPhone patent. 1790 First U.S. patent issued to Samuel Hopkins for creation of potash, an ingredient in fertilizer. 1851 Issac Singer patents a faster, less expensive sewing machine. 1930 Philo Farnsworth patents the first all-electronic television. 1970 Researchers at Corning Glass patent optical fibers, which link computers and communications system. >> The patents shown here have given their inventors monopolies for a limited period of time. Analyze Information How do patents such as these encourage new ideas? A government entity can also grant a franchise. For example, the National Park Service picks a single firm to sell food and other goods at national parks such as Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Everglades. Your school may have contracted with one bottled-water company to install and stock vending machines. The franchise may include a condition that no other brand of water will be sold in the building. Governments, parks, and schools use franchises to keep small markets under control. On a larger scale, governments can issue a license granting firms the right to operate a business, especially where scarce resources are involved. Examples of scarce resources that require licensing include land, as well as radio and television broadcast frequencies. The Federal Communications Commission issues licenses for individual radio and television stations. Local governments might give a single firm a license to manage all of their public parking lots. Industrial Organizations In rare cases, the government allows the companies in an industry to restrict the number of firms in a market. For example, the United States government lets Major League Baseball and other sports leagues restrict the number and location of their teams. The government allows team owners of the major professional sports leagues to choose new cities for their teams and does not charge them with violating the laws that prevent competitors from working together. 150 TOPIC 4 Competition and Market Structures ]]></text>

Demand Major League Baseball has an exemption from these laws, which are known as antitrust laws, because they were originally passed to break up an illegal form of monopoly known as a trust. Other sports leagues do not have an official exemption, but the government treats them as it treats baseball. The restrictions that the leagues impose help keep team play orderly and stable by preventing other cities from starting their own major-league teams and crowding the schedule. The problem with this type of monopoly is that team owners may charge high prices for tickets. In addition, if you&apos;re a sports fan in a city without a major league team, you&apos;re out of luck. SUMMARIzE How does having a patent give a company a monopoly? Output Decisions If you had severe asthma, which can be fatal, what would BreatheDeep be worth to you? You would probably want the medicine no matter how much it cost. So Leland, the company that invented and patented the drug, could charge a very high price for its new medication. The resulting profits would give the company a reason, or incentive, for inventing the new medication in the first place. But could Leland sell as much medication as it wanted to at whatever price it chose? Even a monopolist faces a limited choice&ndash;it can choose either output or price, but not both. The monopolist looks at the big picture and tries to maximize profits. This usually means that, compared to a purely competitive market for the same good, the monopolist produces fewer goods at a higher price. The Monopolist&apos;s Dilemma The law of demand states that buyers will demand more of a good at lower prices and less at higher prices. A possible demand curve for BreatheDeep is shown in Figure 4.3, with prices in dollars on the vertical axis and doses on the horizontal axis. Many people with life- threatening asthma will pay whatever the medicine costs. But some people with milder asthma will choose a cheaper, weaker medicine if the price of a stronger one rises too high. Trace the demand curve from left to right. At $12 per dose, consumers might demand 8,000 doses of BreatheDeep each week. But at $9 per dose, as many as 11,000 doses will sell. The law of demand means that when the monopolist increases the price, it will sell less, and when it lowers the price, it will sell more. Another way to interpret this graph is that if a monopolist produces more, the price of the good will fall, and if it produces less, the price will rise. Falling Marginal Revenue To maximize profits, a seller should set its marginal revenue, or the amount it earns from the last unit sold, equal to its marginal 4.2 Monopolies 151 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="218"> <text><![CDATA[ cost, or the extra cost from producing that unit. This same rule applies to a firm with a monopoly. The key difference is that in a purely competitive market, marginal revenue is always the same as price, and each firm receives the same price no matter how much it produces. Neither assumption is true in a monopoly. To understand how this happens, consider Figure 4.3. When BreatheDeep is sold at $12 per dose, consumers buy 8,000 doses per week, providing $96,000 in revenue. If Leland lowers the price of BreatheDeep to $11 per dose, 9,000 doses will be bought, for a total revenue of $99,000. The sale of 1,000 more doses brings Leland $3,000 in new revenue. Marginal revenue in most markets is equal to price. In this monopoly, the marginal revenue at a market price of $11 is roughly $3 per dose, far below the market price. This is because the lower market price affects both the 1,000 new doses sold and the 8,000 doses people buy for $11 each instead of $12. Now suppose that Leland lowers the price of BreatheDeep from $11 to $10 per dose. Consumers will buy 10,000 doses, for a total revenue of $100,000. This time, the sale of 1,000 more doses brings only $1,000 in additional revenue. The $10,000 in revenue from 1,000 new sales barely exceeds the $9,000 fall Price Setting in a Monopoly Price $12 $11 $9 $6 $3 0 Demandb bb Market Price c cc st lcorginaMaa aa rMarginalevenue 8 9 10 12 Output (in thousands of doses) >> Figure 4.4 A monopolist sets output at point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Analyze Graphs How does point c show the benefits to consumers in a purely competitive market? in revenue from selling the 9,000 doses for $10 each, not $11. The market price is $10 per dose, but the marginal revenue has fallen to a mere $1 for each dose of BreatheDeep sold. As you&apos;ve seen, when a firm has some control over price&ndash;and can cut the price to sell more&ndash; marginal revenue is less than price. In contrast, in a purely competitive market, the price would not drop at all as output increased, so marginal revenue would remain the same as price. The firm&apos;s total revenue would increase at a steady rate with production. The table in Figure 4.3 lists marginal revenues for several different prices. Note that marginal revenue actually becomes negative when the quantity demanded is greater than 10,000 doses per week. Setting a Price Leland will choose a level of output that yields the highest profits. This is the point at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. In Figure 4.3, we plotted the demand at market prices of $8, $9, $10, $11, and $12 per dose. According to Figure 4.3, output per week at these prices will be 12,000, 11,000, 10,000, 9,000, and 8,000 doses, respectively. These points form the market demand curve for BreatheDeep, shown in red in Figure 4.3. Then, based on these data, we plotted Leland&apos;s marginal revenue at these levels of output. These points form the marginal revenue curve shown in blue in Figure 4.4. The marginal revenue curve is at the bottom of the graph, because a monopolist&apos;s marginal revenue is lower than the market price. Marginal cost equals marginal revenue at point ain Figure 4.4. This is the most profitable level of output. The monopolist produces 9,000 units, the quantity at which marginal revenue and marginal cost are both $3. According to the market demand curve, the market price is $11 when 9,000 units are sold (point b). Therefore, the monopolist will set the price of each dose at $11 or set production at 9,000 units. If dozens of firms sold BreatheDeep and the market were purely competitive, price and output would be different, as shown in Figure 4.4. In a purely competitive market, marginal revenue is always equal to market price, so the marginal revenue curve would be the same as the demand curve. Firms will set output where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, shown at point c. As you can see, a purely competitive market for BreatheDeep would have more units sold anda lower market price than a monopoly.

TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS $ $$ $$$ PRICE DISCRIMINATION >> Analyze Charts Would a monopolist benefit from setting the same price for every person? Why or why not? Profits How much profit does the monopolist earn? Well, profit can be determined by comparing price and average cost. For Leland, the company that makes BreatheDeep, the profit per dose is the difference between the market price and the average cost at that level of production. Suppose the average cost of producing 9,000 doses is $5, or slightly higher than the marginal cost. Each dose is sold for $11. The monopolist will earn a profit of $6 per dose ($11 -$5), so the total profit is $54,000, or $6 per dose for 9,000 doses. dRAw CONCLUSIONS What happens if a monopolist increases the price of a good? Price Discrimination The previous example assumed that the monopolist must charge the same price to all consumers. But in some cases, the monopolist may be able to divide consumers into two or more groups and charge a different price to each group. This practice is known as price discrimination. Price discrimination is based on the idea that each customer has a maximum price that he or she will pay for a good. If a monopolist sets the good&apos;s price at the highest maximum price of all the buyers in the market, the monopolist will sell only to the one type of customer willing to pay that much. If the monopolist sets a low price, the monopolist will gain a lot of customers but will lose the profits it could have made from the customers who bought at the low price but were willing to pay more. Although price discrimination is a feature of monopoly, it can be practiced by any company with market power. Market power is the ability to control prices and total market output. As you will read in the next section, many companies have some market power without having a true monopoly. Market power and price discrimination may be found in any market structure except for pure competition. Targeted Discounts In the monopolist&apos;s ideal world, the firm could charge each customer the maximum that he or she is willing to pay, and no less. However, this is impractical, so companies divide consumers into large groups and design pricing policies for each group. The different prices that firms charge each group for the same good or service are not related to production costs. One common form of price discrimination identifies some customers who are not willing to pay the regular price and offers those customers a discount. Price discrimination can also mean that a company finds the customers who need the good the most, and charges them more for that good. Here are some examples of price discrimination. 4.2 Monopolies 153 ]]></text>

Discounted airline fares Airlines offer discounts to travelers who buy tickets several weeks in advance or are willing to spend a Saturday night at their destinations. Business travelers would prefer not to stay over on a Saturday night, but these tickets are appealing to vacationers who wouldn&apos;t otherwise pay to fly and don&apos;t mind the restrictions. Manufacturers&apos; rebate offers At times, manufacturers of refrigerators, cars, televisions, and other items will refund a small part of the purchase price to buyers who fill out a rebate form and mail it back. People who take the time to fulfill the rebate requirements are likely more price-conscious than those who don&apos;t and may be unwilling to pay full price. Senior citizen or student discounts Many retirees and students have lower incomes than people who work full time. Zoos, theaters, museums, and restaurants often offer discounts to people in these groups, because they are unlikely to be able to pay full price for what some consider luxuries. Children fly or stay free promotions Families with young children spend more of their income on food, clothing, and school expenses. As a result, they have less money to spend on vacations. Once again, firms would rather have their business and earn lower profits than earn no profits at all, so they offer discounts for families with children. Limits of Price Discrimination For price discrimination to work, a market must meet three conditions. Firms that use price discrimination must have some market power, customers must be divided into distinct groups, and buyers must not be in a position in which they can easily resell the good or service. Some market power For price discrimination to work, firms must have some control over prices. For this reason, price discrimination doesn&apos;t happen in purely competitive markets. Distinct customer groups The price- discriminating firm must be able to divide customers into distinct groups based on their sensitivity to price. In other words, monopolists must be able to guess the demand curves of different groups, one of which is more elastic, or price-sensitive, than the others. By grouping customers, firms can increase profits by charging each group a different price. Difficult resale If one set of customers could buy the product at the lower price and then resell the product for a profit, the firm could not enforce its price discrimination. Because consumer goods like shoes, groceries, and clothes are easily resold, price discrimination works best in marketing services that are consumed on the spot. Examples include theme- park admissions and restaurant meals. Airlines can offer senior discounts because the company can ask for identification and proof of age before letting the customer board the plane. Although most forms of price discrimination are perfectly legal, sometimes firms use price discrimination to drive other firms out of business. This illegal form of the practice is called predatory pricing. PARAPhRASE Price discrimination can only work if ASSESSMENT 1. Identify Cause and Effect How can technology affect a monopoly? 2.

Each firm is monopolistic&ndash;it holds a monopoly over its own particular product design. You can think of monopolistic competition as a modified version of pure competition with minor differences in products. The differences between pure competition and monopolistic competition arise because monopolistically competitive firms sell goods that are similar enough to be substituted for one another but are not identical.

Unlike pure competition, monopolistic competition is a fact of everyday life. You and your friends probably buy from monopolistically competitive firms several times a week. Common examples include bagel shops, ice-cream stands, gas stations, and retail stores. Four Conditions of Monopolistic Competition Monopolistic competition develops from four conditions. As you read about the types of markets that favor monopolistic competition, note how similar they are to the rules that define pure competition. Many firms As a rule, monopolistically competitive markets are not marked by economies of scale. They do not have high start-up costs. Because firms can begin selling goods and earning money after a small initial investment, new firms spring up quickly to join the market. Few artificial barriers to entry Firms in a monopolistically competitive market do not face high barriers to entry. Patents do not protect anyone from competition, either because they have expired or because each firm sells a product that is distinct enough to fall outside the zone of patent protection. Just like a purely competitive market, a monopolistically competitive market includes so many competing firms that producers cannot work together to keep out new competitors. Little control over price In a monopolistically competitive market structure, each firm&apos;s goods are a little different from everyone else&apos;s, and some people are willing to pay more for the difference. For this reason, price competition does not occur, and firms have a bit of freedom to raise or lower their prices. However, unlike a monopoly, a monopolistically competitive firm has only limited control over price. If the price rises too high, consumers will buy a rival&apos;s product that is a close substitute. For example, many customers will choose a carton of brand-name orange juice over the store brand even if it costs $0.50 more per carton. If the difference in price rose to $2, however, most people would think seriously about buying the store brand of orange juice or some other drink altogether. Differentiated products Firms have some control over their selling price because they can differentiate, or distinguish their goods from the other products in the market. The ability to differentiate goods is the main way that monopolistic competition differs from pure competition.

RECALL A monopolistically competitive firm has some control over price because Non-price Competition The ability to differentiate products means that firms do not have to compete on price alone. The alternative is non-price competition, or competition through ways other than lower prices. Non-price competition takes several different forms. Physical characteristics The simplest way for a firm to distinguish its products is to offer a new size, color, shape, texture, or taste. Running shoes, pens, cars, and toothpaste are good examples of products that can be easily differentiated by their physical characteristics. A pen is always a writing tool that uses ink, but many people will pay extra for a pen that looks or writes differently. Similarly, you can probably describe a “car” in only a few words, but factories around the world manufacture thousands of car models to fit a range of personalities, jobs, families, and incomes. Location Real-estate agents say that the three most important factors when buying property are “location, location, location.” Some goods can be differentiated by where they are sold. Gas stations, movie theaters, and grocery stores succeed or fail based on their locations. A convenience store in the middle of a desert differentiates its product simply by selling it hundreds of miles away from the nearest competitor. Such a location allows the seller to charge a lot more for a quart of water. Service level Some sellers can charge higher prices because they offer their customers a high level of service. Conventional restaurants and fast-food restaurants both offer meals to customers. However, conventional restaurants provide servers who bring the food to your table, whereas fast-food restaurants offer a more bare-bones, do-it-yourself atmosphere. Conventional restaurants and fast-food chains sell many of the same food items, but fast-food chains sell their meals for less. Customers at conventional restaurants pay more for the service and the relaxing atmosphere. Advertising, image, or status Firms often use advertising to point out differences between their own offerings and other products in the marketplace. These product differences are often more a matter of perception than reality. For example, a designer can apply his or her name to a plain white T-shirt and charge a higher price, even if the quality of >> Analyze Political Cartoons How is this cartoon an illustration of monopolistic competition? >> Location is one characteristic of non-price competition.

CATEgORIzE A hotel that offers a complimentary fruit basket and an employee who will help you plan your activities is an example of what kind of non-price competition? Prices, Output, and Profits Economists study prices, output, and profits when comparing market structures. They find that under monopolistic competition, the market looks very much as it would under pure competition. Prices Prices under monopolistic competition will be higher than they would be in pure competition, because firms have some power to raise prices. However, the number of firms and ease of entry prevent companies from raising prices as high as they would if they were a true monopoly. As you have read, if a monopolistically competitive firm raised prices too high, most customers would buy the cheaper product. Because customers can choose from among many substitutes, monopolistically competitive firms face more elastic demand curves than true monopolists do. Output The law of demand says that output and price are negatively related. As one rises, the other falls. Monopolistically competitive firms sell their products at higher prices than do purely competitive firms, but at lower prices than a monopoly. As a result, total output under monopolistic competition falls somewhere between that of monopoly and that of pure competition. Profits Like purely competitive firms, monopolistically competitive firms earn just enough to cover all of their costs, including salaries for the workers. If a monopolistically competitive firm started to earn profits well above its costs, two market trends would work to take those profits away. First, fierce competition would encourage rivals to find new ways to differentiate their products and lure customers back. If one company hires a basketball star to promote its soft drink, a rival might hire a popular singer. The rivalries among firms prevent any one firm from earning excessive profits for long. Second, new firms will enter the market with slightly different products that cost less than the market leader&apos;s. If the original good costs too much, consumers will switch to these substitutes. You&apos;ve seen this happen when a brand-name line of clothing or a video game becomes popular. Competitors quickly flood the market with cheap imitations to appeal to people who can&apos;t afford the original or don&apos;t care about the difference in quality. Although monopolistically competitive firms can earn profits in the short run, they have to work hard to keep their product distinct to stay ahead of their rivals. Often, they do not succeed. Production Costs and Variety Firms in monopolistic competition may not be able to produce their goods at the lowest possible average cost.

But consumers in these markets benefit from having a wide variety of goods from which to choose. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT Why can&apos;t a monopolistically competitive firm raise prices as high as a true monopoly can? Characteristics of Oligopoly Oligopoly describes a market dominated by a few large, profitable firms. Oligopoly looks like an imperfect form of monopoly. Some economists call an industry an oligopoly if the four largest firms produce at least 70 to 80 percent of the output. Acting on their own or as a team, the biggest firms in an oligopoly may well set prices higher and output lower than in a purely competitive market. Examples of oligopolies in the United States include the markets for air travel, automobiles, breakfast cereals, and household appliances. Barriers to Entry An oligopoly can form when significant barriers to entry keep new companies from entering the market to compete with existing firms. These barriers can be technological, or they can be created by a system of government licenses or patents. In other cases, the economic realities of the market lead to an oligopoly. Take the video game console industry, for example. The three big game console manufacturers have invested so much money to develop their brand names and products associated with those games that few companies can successfully challenge such a grip on the market. High start-up costs such as expensive machinery and large production facilities present additional barriers to entry. Many small airlines have had trouble competing with larger, better-financed rivals because airplanes are very expensive to buy and maintain. The biggest airlines compound the problem because they often own the most desirable gates at the airport, and already enjoy name recognition and the trust of the consumer. Some oligopolies occur because of economies of scale. As you have read, when a firm experiences economies of scale, the average cost of production decreases as output increases. Greater economies of scale mean that there will be fewer firms in an industry. In a monopoly market, only one company can produce enough goods to earn a profit. In an oligopoly, perhaps three or four companies can reach a profitable level of output 4.3 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly 159 ]]></text>

Cooperation and Collusion Oligopoly presents a big challenge to government, because oligopolistic firms often seemto work together as a monopoly, even when they are not actually doing so. Many government regulations try to make oligopolistic firms act more like competitive firms. When determined oligopolists work together illegally to set prices and bar competing firms from the market, they can become as damaging to the consumer as a monopoly. The three practices that concern government the most are price leadership, collusion, and cartels. While these three practices represent ways that firms in an oligopoly can try to control a market, they don&apos;t always work. Each tactic includes an incentive for the firms to cheat and thereby undo any benefits. Sometimes the market leader in an oligopoly can start a round of price increases or price cuts by making its plans clear to other sellers. This firm becomes a price leader. Price leaders can set prices and output for entire industries as long as other member firms go along with the leader&apos;s policy. But disagreements among those companies can spark a price war, when competitors cut their prices very low to win business. A price war is harmful to OPEC Oil Production, 2012 producers but good for consumers because they will pay less for a good or service. Collusion refers to an agreement among members of an oligopoly to illegally set prices and production levels. One outcome of collusion is called price fixing, an agreement among firms to sell at the same or very similar prices. Collusive agreements set prices and output at the levels that would be chosen by a monopolist. Collusion is illegal in the United States, but the lure of monopolistic profits can tempt businesses to make such agreements despite the illegality and risks. Collusion is not, however, the only reason for nearly identical pricing in oligopolistic industries. Such pricing may actually result from intense competition, especially if advertising is vigorous and new lines of products are being introduced. Cartels Stronger than a collusive agreement, a cartel is an agreement by a formal organization of producers to coordinate prices and production. Although other countries and international organizations permit them, cartels are illegal in the United States. OPEC is perhaps the most familiar international cartel. Cartels can survive only if every member keeps to its agreed-upon output levels. Otherwise, prices will fall, and firms will lose profits. However, each member has a strong incentive to cheat and produce World Oil Production, 2012 Algeria Angola Ecuador Iran Iraq Kuwait Libya Nigeria Qatar Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Venezuela 1,875 1,872 505 3,589 2,987 2,797 1,483 2,524 1,579 11,726 3,213 2,489 OPEC NATIONS OIL PRODUCTION (IN THOUSANDS OF BARRELS PER DAY) OPEC Nations United States Russia China Canada Mexico Other 41% 22.3% 3.3% 12.4% 11.7% 5% 4.3% SOURCE: U.S. Energy Information Administration >> Analyze Data Based on the amount of oil that each nation produces, which two OPEC nations are most important to the cartel? 160 TOPIC 4 Competition and Market Structures ]]></text>

Recall that market power is the ability of a firm to control prices and total market output. This can be bad for the consumer and for the economy as a whole. Markets dominated by one firm or a few large ones tend to have higher prices and lower output than markets with many sellers. Competition is reduced. Before we look at antitrust policies, let&apos;s look at ways in which a firm might try to increase its market power.

Economists are skeptical about most claims of predatory pricing, because the predator loses money each time it drives an endless series of rivals out of business. Antitrust Laws The federal government has a number of policies that keep firms from controlling the price and supply of important goods. If a firm controls a large share of a market, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice&apos;s Antitrust Division will watch the firm closely to ensure that it does not unfairly force out its competitors. These government policies are known as antitrust laws. A trust is a business combination similar to a cartel. In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlawed mergers and monopolies that limit trade between states. This and other laws gave the government the power to regulate industry, to stop firms from forming cartels or monopolies, and to break up existing monopolies. Over the years, Congress passed new laws to outlaw other anticompetitive practices. Even though these actions have restricted businesses&apos; actions, they have generally benefited consumers. Despite the antitrust laws, companies have used many strategies to gain control over their markets. Some firms require a customer who buys one product to buy other products from the same Comparing Browser Usage company, whether or not the customer wants them. For example, the manufacturer of a popular tennis shoe can demand that a chain also buy and resell its brand-name shirts, windbreakers, and watches if it wants to sell its shoes. Buying out competitors is another strategy used by many large firms. Regulating Business Practices The government has the power to regulate all of these practices if they give too much power to a company that already has few competitors. Microsoft is such a company. It sells operating systems, software that tells a computer how to run. In 1997, the Department of Justice accused Microsoft of using its near- monopoly over the operating-system market to try to take control of the browser market. A browser is a program that allows people to access Web sites. Microsoft insisted that computer manufacturers selling its operating system must also include its browser. The government accused Microsoft of predatory pricing, because the company gave away its browser for free, a policy that could ruin the other browser company, Netscape. Microsoft&apos;s power in one market gave it a big&ndash;and possibly unfair&ndash; advantage in a related market. Microsoft argued that the browser was part of its operating system and could not be sold separately.

The company appealed, and in 2001, the Justice Department and Microsoft reached an agreement to settle the case. According to the settlement, Microsoft could link its browser to its operating system but could not force computer manufacturers to provide only Microsoft software on new computers. The Microsoft browser had a large share of the market at the time. Partly as a result of the settlement, competing browsers have entered the market and attracted a fair share of users, as Figure 4.5 shows. Splitting Up Monopolies In 1911, the government used the Sherman Antitrust Act to break up two monopolies, John D. Rockefeller&apos;s Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company. The Supreme Court ordered these powerful monopolies to split apart into competing firms. Antitrust laws have been put to use many times since then. These laws have generally helped companies that tried to compete with the monopolies, and as a result, have lowered prices and given more options to consumers. In 1982, the government reached an agreement with American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) to break up the company into seven regional phone companies. Two years later, in 1984, the new companies, including BellSouth, US West, and Pacific Telesis, began operating. Because the government had treated local telephone service as a natural monopoly, AT&T had legally controlled all the cables and networks that linked telephones in homes and businesses. The government stepped in only when AT&T used its legal monopoly on local phone service to take control of other markets for long-distance phone calls and communications equipment. Today, the larger telephone companies offer plans that include nationwide long-distance along with local phone service. However, numerous smaller firms still compete in the market for long- distance service. Although the breakup of AT&T cost thousands of workers their jobs, consumers have benefited from lower prices and improved technology. Assessing Mergers In addition to breaking up existing monopolies, the government has the power to prevent the rise of monopolies. The government does this by blocking mergers that might reduce competition and lead to higher prices. A merger occurs when a company joins with another company or companies to form a single firm.

You read earlier that prices often fall when the number of firms in a market increases. The reverse is also true. Prices often rise when the number of firms in a market decreases. When the government considers whether or not to approve a merger, it tries to predict the effects of the merger on prices and service. Sometimes it determines that the effects will be minimal. In 2000, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission both approved the merger of media giants America Online (AOL) and Time Warner. Approval came with several conditions designed to ensure consumer choice. Two years later, the government drew a different conclusion when the FTC blocked the merger of the glassware makers Libbey and Anchor Hocking. The FTC argued that the merger would create a monopoly. A federal court agreed, and the deal fell apart. Merger Guidelines Although some mergers hurt consumers by reducing competition, others can actually benefit consumers. In these cases, corporate mergers will lower overall average costs and lead to lower prices, more reliable products or service, and a more efficient industry. The government must act carefully to make the right decision. In 1992, the Justice Department and the FTC released guidelines for proposed mergers. The basic theme of the guidelines was that “mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power.” As revised in 1997, the guidelines gave companies the chance to prove that the merger would generate efficiencies, leading to lower costs and prices. IdENTIfy What kinds of rules and regulations does the government use to break up monopolies? Deregulation In the late 1970s and 1980s, Congress decided that some government regulation was reducing competition. It passed laws to deregulate several industries. Deregulation means that the government no longer decides what role each company can play in a market and how much it can charge its customers. Over several years, the government deregulated the airline, trucking, banking, railroad, natural gas, and television broadcasting industries. Depending on the degree of deregulation, the government&apos;s action allowed&ndash;or forced&ndash;firms in these industries to compete by eliminating many price controls and barriers to entry. 4.4 Government Regulation and Competition 165 ]]></text>

In some cases, the economic facts that created the need for regulation in the first place have changed. In an earlier Lesson, you read about how cellular phones challenged the natural monopoly of local phone service and opened the market to new companies. The trucking industry was also regulated as a natural monopoly from the early 1900s until 1978. By then, many people had decided that the government was regulating industries that were not natural monopolies at all. Judging Deregulation Deregulation has met with mixed success. In most cases, many new firms entered the deregulated industries right away. Competition certainly increased in the airline, trucking, and banking industries. Typically, years of wild growth were followed by the disappearance of some firms. This weeding out of weaker players is considered healthy for the economy, but it can be hard on workers in the short term. In the 1990s, several states deregulated their electricity markets to allow private, competing companies to produce and sell energy to homeowners. In some markets, energy prices fell, but elsewhere, customers paid more. California experienced a massive energy crisis in 2000 that forced the state to pay extraordinarily high rates for electricity. Many attributed this crisis to private energy companies, such as Enron, that may have used deregulation rules to create an electricity shortage. Enron later declared bankruptcy, and several of its executives faced criminal charges. California reacted to the crisis by reinstating some limits on competition. Airline Deregulation: Mixed Results Many new airlines started operating after President Carter deregulated the industry in 1978, but some eventually failed or were acquired by other companies. Freed from regulatory restriction, many of the large airlines competed aggressively for the busiest routes. For most travelers, increased competition created lower prices. However, many busy airports now have one or two dominant airlines. In some cases, fares are actually higher than before deregulation. In the early 2000s, changing conditions transformed the airlines. Over-expansion and sharply rising labor costs squeezed profits. The terrorist hijackings of four commercial passenger jets on September 11, 2001, caused many people to stop flying. Revenues plunged while costs for security, Average Round-Trip Airfare, 1979–2011 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 $200 $250 $300 $350 $400 $450 $500 $550 $600 $650 SOURCE: Airlines for America After 10 years of deregulation, average ticket price had decreased 13 percent. Between 1979 and 2009, average ticket price decreased 48 percent. Between 2009 and 2012, baggage charges and other fees raised average ticket price by nearly 16 percent.

For several airlines, the solution to their financial difficulties was to merge with another airline. The early 2000s saw several mergers of major airlines. These included American Airlines and TWA in 2001 and Delta and Northwest Airlines in 2008. Another merger proposed in 2013 between American Airlines and US Airways triggered an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department. The settlement of that suit involved the airlines&apos; reducing their dominant positions at certain large airports. That meant giving up control of gates and slots. Gates are where passengers depart from and arrive at airports; slots are runways. These changes promised to open up space for new airlines and thus increase competition.

Lesson 1: Pure Competition LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.6 Pure competition is a market structure in which a large number of firms produce identical products, no buyer or seller has a large enough share of the market to influence the price, buyers and sellers are well informed, and firms must be able to enter or leave the market easily. Under pure competition, the profits are greatest when producers&apos; marginal cost just equals the price. Lesson 2: Monopolies SS.912.E.1.6, SS.912.E.2.6 A monopoly exists when barriers prevent potential competitors from entering a market with a single supplier. Economies of scale, in which costs fall as output increases, typify natural monopolies, markets that run most efficiently with a single supplier. Governments generally regulate natural monopolies, in return for allowing firms to control them, so that excessive profits do not hurt consumers. Patents, which give inventors exclusive rights to income from their inventions, create temporary monopolies to reward creativity. Monopolies can maximize profits at higher prices and lower quantities supplied than firms in a competitive market. Lesson 3: Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly SS.912.E.1.6, SS.912.E.1.8 Monopolistic competition involves competition among firms selling products that are similar but not identical. Products are distinguished through differentiation, such as branding. Firms engage not only in competition through pricing, but also in non-price competition, or competition over the quality of goods, level of service, status, or location. Prices in monopolistic competition are higher than in pure competition because no exact substitutes exist for products. Oligopoly is a market structure in which a small number of firms control the market and can influence prices by adjusting supply. Under oligopoly, firms may engage in collusion, or an agreement to illegally set prices and production levels. Lesson 4: Government Regulation and Competition SS.912.E.1.6, SS.912.E.2.4 Oligopolies and monopolies have market power, because they can set prices above the level that would exist in more competitive markets, or they may set prices below market levels to drive rivals out of business, a practice known as predatory pricing. Antitrust laws enable governments to prevent the formation of anti-competitive conditions such as monopolies or collusion, or to force the breakup of monopolistic firms. Deregulation is a process in which governments seek to increase competition by eliminating government regulations that stand in its way. ]]></text>

The government later dropped its lawsuit when the airlines addressed some of its concerns. DOCUMENT A The Department of Justice, headed by Attorney General Eric Holder, explains why it filed its lawsuit. The Department of Justice, six state attorneys general and the District of Columbia filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today challenging the proposed $11 billion merger between US Airways Group Inc. and American Airlines&apos; parent corporation, AMR Corp. The department said that the merger, which would result in the creation of the world&apos;s largest airline, would substantially lessen competition for commercial air travel in local markets throughout the United States and result in passengers paying higher airfares and receiving less service. . . . “Airline travel is vital to millions of American consumers who fly regularly for either business or pleasure,” said Attorney General Eric Holder. “By challenging this merger, the Department of Justice is saying that the American people deserve better.” &ndash;U.S. Department of Justice News Release, August 13, 2013 DOCUMENT B In this press release, the incoming chief executive officer (CEO) of the merged airline explains what he sees as the benefits of the merger. “We are eager to show that the DOJ&apos;s action would deny millions of customers access to a more competitive airline that will offer customers what they want, delivering significant benefits to consumers, communities and employees,” said Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO, US Airways, incoming CEO of the combined company. “The new American Airlines is predicated on growth. This merger is the foundation of American&apos;s plan to exit bankruptcy and is the cornerstone of American&apos;s and US Airways&apos; plan to form a more competitive and cost-effective airline to take on the country&apos;s largest air carriers &ndash; Delta, United Airlines, and Southwest &ndash; and a number of fast-growing low-cost carriers, including Virgin America, JetBlue, Spirit, and Allegiant.” &ndash;American Airlines News Release, August 22, 2013 DOCUMENT C 14.7% United 5.3% JetBlue 25.0% Others 20.1% American (merged with US Airways) 18.0% Southwest16.9% Delta SOURCE: U.S. Department of Transportation This graph shows the U.S. domestic market shares, in passenger miles, of airlines in 2014–2015. 22.

In this section, you will learn that being your own boss has its advantages as well as its disadvantages. A sole proprietorship is a business owned and managed by a single individual. In this type of business organization, which is the ownership structure of a company or firm, the lone entrepreneur earns all of the firm&apos;s profits and is responsible for ll all of its debts. This type of company is by far the most popular in the United States. According to the Internal Revenue Service, more than 70 percent of all businesses are organized as sole proprietorships. Most sole proprietorships are small, however. All together, they generate only about 4 percent of all sales in the United States. Many types of businesses can flourish as sole proprietorships. Look around your neighborhood or town. It is more likely than not that your local bakery, your barber shop or hair salon, your bike-repair shop, and the corner grocery store are all sole proprietorships.

To be successful, sole proprietors have to be risk takers. They have to be willing to risk failure for greater satisfaction, and perhaps greater financial gain. The profile of an entrepreneur includes other essential qualities. The person hoping to start a business has to be able to answer “yes” to a series of questions. Are you organized? Are you responsible? Are you energetic? Are you goal-oriented? Do you know how to run a business? You may be the best cook in the world, but if you know nothing about the business end of running a restaurant, you are likely to fail. Steve Case, co-founder of America Online, is a model of the successful entrepreneur who believed in himself and had the vision that a company could thrive on the Internet. If you&apos;re doing something new, you&apos;ve got to have a vision. You&apos;ve got to have a perspective. You&apos;ve got to have some North Star you&apos;re aiming for, and you just believe somehow you&apos;ll get there . . . . You&apos;ve got to stick with it, because these things are not overnight successes . . . . &ndash;from an interview with Academy of Achievement, July 12, 2004 Even though sole proprietorships can be started with an idea and a lot of determination, small business owners are taking on a number of economic responsibilities. If you have employees besides yourself, you&apos;ll need to pay them. You are responsible for making this payroll. By the same token, you are economically responsible for paying your bills. You will likely have rent and utilities to cover. Small businesses benefit from government services just like individuals. Therefore, a small business has an economic responsibility to pay taxes to the government, just as individuals do. Small businesses with employees must also pay employment taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes and federal unemployment taxes.

Sole proprietors may have access to loans, grants, and training courses on different aspects of running a business. 178 TOPIC 5 Business and Labor Advantages of Sole Proprietorships While you need to do more than just hang out a sign to start your own business, a sole proprietorship is simple to establish. It also offers the owner several advantages. Easy to Start and End Easy start-up is the main advantage of the sole proprietorship. With just a small amount of paperwork and legal expense, just about anyone can start such a business. The exact requirements vary from city to city and state to state. Typically, though, sole proprietors must meet the following minimum requirements: Authorization Many sole proprietors must obtain a business license, which is an authorization from the local government to operate a business. Certain professionals, such as doctors and day-care providers, may also need a special license from the state. Site permit If not operating the business out of his or her home, a sole proprietor must obtain a certificate of occupancy to use another building for business. Some zoning laws prohibit doing business in a residential area. Name If not using his or her own name as the name of the business, a sole proprietor must register a business name. This paperwork often takes only a day or two to complete. Because they require little legal paperwork, sole proprietorships are usually the least expensive form of ownership to establish. The federal government offers aid to entrepreneurs to help their businesses grow. Once a business has been started, the federal government&apos;s Small Business Administration provides a variety of loan programs and other support. When you start a small business like a sole proprietorship, you have economic rights. The economic rights of small businesses are protected by laws and regulations that allow businesses to open and operate freely. These economic rights include the right to purchase property, sell products and services at the prices you set, and have equal opportunities in the economy. Relatively Few Regulations A sole proprietorship is the least-regulated form of business organization. Even the smallest business, however, is subject to some regulation, especially industry-specific rules. For example, a soft pretzel stand would be subject to health codes, and a furniture refinishing business would have to follow laws about disposing of dangerous chemicals. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="245"> <text><![CDATA[ Sole proprietorships may also be subject to local zoning laws. Cities and towns often designate certain areas, or zones, for residential use and for business. Zoning laws may prohibit sole proprietors from operating businesses out of their homes. Sole Receiver of Profit A major advantage of the sole proprietorship is that the owner gets to keep all profits after paying income taxes. If the business succeeds, the owner does not have to share the success with anyone else. The desire for profits motivates many people to start their own businesses. Full Control Another advantage of sole proprietorship is that sole proprietors can run their businesses as they wish. This high degree of freedom appeals to entrepreneurs. Fast, flexible decision making allows sole proprietors to take full advantage of sudden opportunities. These entrepreneurs can respond quickly to changes in the marketplace. Finally, if sole proprietors decide to stop operations and do something else for a living, they can do so easily. They must, of course, pay all debts and other obligations, such as taxes, but they do not have to meet any other legal obligations to stop doing business. Many small businesses rent office or storefront space, but there are advantages to purchasing it as well. For example, it can be difficult and expensive to adapt a rental space to the particular needs of your business. However, if you purchase the property, you have the ability to make the changes you want more easily. If you rent, you will not receive anything in return when you move out. If you purchase, the property belongs to you, and you will be able to sell it. Although the upfront cost may be higher, purchasing can be a good option. dRAw CONCLUSIONS Why are sole proprietorships easy to start and end? Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorships As with everything else, there are trade-offs with sole proprietorships. The independence of this form of business organization comes with a high degree of responsibility.

Sole proprietors are fully and personally responsible for all their business debts. If the business fails, the owner may have to sell personal property&ndash;such as a car or home&ndash;to cover any outstanding obligations. Business debts can ruin a sole proprietor&apos;s personal finances. Limited Access to Resources Suppose you start a landscaping business that grows quickly. You might need to expand your business by buying more equipment. But as a sole proprietor, you may have to pay for that equipment out of your own pocket. Banks are sometimes unwilling to offer loans to a business that has not been operating for very long. This makes it difficult or impossible for many sole proprietorships to expand quickly. Physical capital may not be the only resource in short supply. Human capital may be lacking, too. A sole proprietor, no matter how ambitious, may lack some of the skills necessary to run a business successfully. For example, you may be great at sales but not at accounting. You may love working outdoors as a landscaper but hate to call on people to drum up business. Some aspects of the business suffer if the owner&apos;s skills do not match the needs of the business. Finally, as a sole proprietor, you may have to turn down work because you simply do not have enough hours in the day or enough workers to keep up with demand. A small business often presents its owner with too many demands, and that can be exhausting, both personally and financially. Lack of Permanence A sole proprietorship has a limited life. If a sole proprietor dies or retires, the business simply ceases to exist if there is no one willing to buy it or run it. The same can happen if the owner suffers an extended illness or loses interest in the business. Sole proprietorships often have trouble finding and keeping good employees. Small businesses generally cannot offer the security and advancement opportunities that many employees look for in a job. In addition, a sole proprietorship usually has limited access to capital, which means that most small business owners lack the resources to offer workers fringe benefits. Fringe benefits are payments to employees other than wages or salaries, such as paid vacation, retirement pay, and health insurance. Lack of experienced employees can hurt a business. Once again, the other side of total control is total responsibility: a sole proprietor cannot count on anyone else to maintain the business.

In the United States, partnerships account for nearly 10 percent of all businesses. They generate almost 15 percent of all receipts and just over a quarter of all the income earned by all businesses. Partnerships are a good choice if owners are willing to share both the responsibility of running the business and the economic right to enjoy the profits it earns. They can also be a good choice if the partners get along well and have skills that complement each other. Partnerships fall into three categories: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships. Each divides responsibility and liability differently. General Partnership The most common type of partnership is the general partnership. In this type, all partners share equally in both responsibility and liability.

Similarly, they share proportionately in the rewards from the business. Many of the same kinds of businesses that operate as sole proprietorships can operate as general partnerships. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals often form partnerships. Small retail stores, farms, construction firms, and family businesses often form partnerships as well. Limited Partnership In a limited partnership, only one partner is required to be a general partner. That is, only one partner has unlimited personal liability for the firm&apos;s actions. The remaining partner or partners contribute only money. If the business fails, they can lose only the amount of their initial investment. If the business succeeds, though, limited partners share in the profits. A limited partnership must have at least one general partner but may have any number of limited partners. Limited partners play no role in managing the business. The general partner runs the company. That control is the main advantage of being a general partner. The main drawback, of course, is the unlimited liability that the general partner has. Limited Liability Partnerships The limited liability partnership (LLP) is a newer type of partnership recognized by many states. In this type of partnership, all partners are limited partners. An LLP functions like a general partnership, except that all partners have limited personal liability in certain situations, such as another partner&apos;s mistakes. Not all types of businesses are allowed to register as limited liability partnerships. Most states allow professionals such as attorneys, physicians, dentists, and accountants to register as LLPs. CONTRAST What is the chief financial difference between a general partner and a limited partner? Advantages of Partnerships Partnerships are easy to establish and are subject to few government regulations. They provide entrepreneurs with a number of advantages. Ease of Start-Up Like proprietorships, partnerships are easy and inexpensive to establish. The law does not require a written partnership agreement. Most experts, however, advise partners to work with an attorney to develop articles of partnership, or a partnership agreement. This legal document spells out each partner&apos;s economic rights and responsibilities. It outlines how partners will share profits or losses. It may also address other details, such as the ways new partners can join the firm, the duration of the partnership, and tax responsibilities. If partners do not develop their own articles of partnership, they will fall under the rules of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). The UPA is a law adopted by most states to establish rules for partnerships. The UPA requires common ownership interests, profit and loss sharing, and shared management responsibilities. Liability in Different Types of Partnerships BUSINESS LOSS TYPE OF PARTNERSHIP PARTNERS&apos; PERSONAL LIABILITY General Partnership Limited Partnership Limited Partnership $150,000 $150,000 $150,000 General Partner A $50,000 General Partner A $75,000 General Partner A $150,000 General Partner B $50,000 General Partner B $75,000 Limited Partner W $0 General Partner C $50,000 Limited Partner W $0 Limited Partner X $0 >> The table shows how the same business loss might be shared by partners in three different partnerships.

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP At least 1 general partner runs the business. At least 1 limited partner with limited liability. PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURES General partner Limited partner >> Compare and Contrast How do limited liability partnerships differ from the other two types of partnerships? Like sole proprietorships, partnerships are subject to little government regulation. The partnership may face certain government regulations because of the nature of its work. Medical partnerships, for instance, must follow government regulations regarding safe handling of biomedical waste. Some kinds of businesses face limits on their operations due to zoning laws. The government does not dictate how partnerships conduct business, however. Partners have the right to distribute profits in whatever way they wish, as long as they abide by the partnership agreement or by the UPA. Financial Impact A major advantage of partnerships is the ability to raise capital. In a partnership, more than one person contributes assets, or money and other valuables. As a result, these businesses can raise more capital than a sole proprietorship. In addition, partnerships have improved ability to borrow funds for operations or expansion. Partnerships offer advantages to employees as well. They can attract and keep talented employees more easily than sole proprietorships can. Graduates from top accounting schools, for example, often seek jobs with large and prestigious accounting LLPs, hoping to become partners themselves someday. Partnerships, like sole proprietorships, are not subject to any special taxes. Partners do have the legal and economic responsibility to pay taxes on their share of the income that the partnership generates, of course. The business itself does not have to pay taxes, however. Shared Decision Making In a sole proprietorship, the owner has the burden of making all business decisions. In a partnership, the responsibility for the business may be shared. A sole proprietorship requires the owner to wear many hats, some of which might not fit very well. For example, the sole proprietor may have good managerial abilities but lack marketing skills and experience. In a successful partnership, each partner brings different strengths and skills to the business. CONTRAST Why are partnerships better able to raise capital than sole proprietorships? Disadvantages of Partnerships Partnerships also present some disadvantages. Many of the disadvantages of sole proprietorships are present in partnerships. Limited liability partnerships have fewer disadvantages than partnerships with general partners. All partnerships, however, have the potential for conflict. 5.2 Partnerships and Franchises 183 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="250"> <text><![CDATA[ Unlimited Liability Unless the partnership is an LLP, at least one partner has unlimited liability. As in a sole proprietorship, any general partner has full responsibility for any financial obligations the firm takes on. General partners have the potential to lose everything, including personal property, if necessary to pay the firm&apos;s debts. Since limited partners can lose only their investment, they have the economic right to avoid this threat. In a partnership, each general partner is bound by the acts of all other general partners. If one partner&apos;s actions cause the firm losses, then all of the general partners suffer. If one doctor in a partnership is sued for malpractice, all of the doctors in the partnership stand to lose. This problem is not present, of course, in limited liability partnerships. Potential for Conflict As in any close relationship, partnerships have the potential for conflict. If a business has more than one general partner, each one has only partial control over the firm. None of them enjoys as much freedom as sole proprietors do. Partnership agreements address technical aspects of the business, such as profit and loss. Many issues vital to the success of the business exist outside these guidelines, however. Partners need to ensure that they agree on matters such as work habits, management style, ethics, and general business philosophies. Still, friction between partners often arises and can be difficult to resolve. Many partnerships dissolve because of these interpersonal conflicts. Partners must learn to communicate openly and find ways to resolve conflicts to ensure the survival of their business. Lack of Permanence Like a sole proprietorship, a partnership may not outlast the life of one of the general partners. If a partner dies or decides to leave, the partnership might cease to exist unless the articles of partnership state that the business can continue and the remaining partner or partners have the needed resources. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS What does a person give up by changing from being a sole proprietor to being a general partner? The Franchise Alternative Sole proprietorships can suffer from a lack of resources or the lack of skills on the part of the owner. Some people solve these problems by forming partnerships.

One type of franchise is issued by government authorities. These franchises give one firm the sole right to sell its goods within a limited market, such as within a national park. In business, too, a franchise signals exclusive rights. A business franchise is a semi-independent business that pays fees to a parent company. In return, the business is granted the exclusive right to sell a certain product or service in a given area. Franchises offer a wide array of goods and services, from fast- food restaurants to stores that sell diamonds. In this arrangement, the parent company is called a franchiser. The franchiser develops the products and systems to produce them to improve efficiency and reliability. Franchisers then work with local franchise owners to help them produce and sell their products. Each owner is called a franchisee. Franchising has become popular in recent years. This is because franchises allow each owner a degree of control. At the same time, the owners benefit from the support of the parent company. Of course, franchises offer both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of Franchises A franchise provides certain advantages that a completely independent business cannot have. First, a franchise comes Bounce to Activate Illustration with a built-in reputation. Consumers may already be familiar with the product and brand. Other advantages help the franchisee assume the responsibilities of the business by supporting him or her in running the business: &bull; Management training and support Franchisers help owners gain the experience they need to succeed by running training and support programs. &bull; Standardized quality Most parent companies require franchise owners to follow certain rules and processes to guarantee product quality. High-quality products attract customers. &bull; National advertising programs Parent companies pay for advertising campaigns to establish their brand names. These ads can increase sales for each franchisee. &bull; Financial assistance Some franchisers provide financing to help franchise owners start their businesses. This aid can help people with fewer resources enjoy the economic right of becoming business owners. &bull; Centralized buying power Franchisers buy materials in bulk for all of their franchise locations. They pass on the savings to their franchisees. 5.2 Partnerships and Franchises 185 ]]></text>

Sole proprietorships and partnerships lack the resources to carry out expensive processes, such as making cars, or having operations that reach across the country or around the world. What form of business organization do these companies have? Most of these businesses are corporations. The most complex form of business organization is the corporation. A corporation is a legal entity, or being, owned by individual stockholders, each of whom has limited liability for the firm&apos;s debts. Stockholders own stock, a certificate of ownership in a corporation. Each person who owns stock is a part-owner of the corporation issuing it. If a corporation issues 1,000 shares of stock, and you purchase 1 share, you own 1/1000th of the corporation. Sole proprietorships have no identity beyond that of the owners. A corporation, on the other hand, does have a legal identity separate from the identities of its owners. Legally, it is regarded much like an individual. A corporation may engage in business, make contracts, sue other parties or be sued by others, and pay taxes.

    <page pageNumber="254"> <text><![CDATA[ In the United States, corporations account for about 20 percent of all businesses but more than 80 percent of all sales. They generate nearly 60 percent of the net income earned in the nation. Because of the advantages of corporations, most large business firms do incorporate, or become corporations. Types of Corporations Some corporations issue stock to only a few people, often family members. These stockholders rarely trade their stock, but instead pass it on, typically within the family. Such corporations are called closely held corporations. They are also known as privately held corporations. A publicly held corporation, however, has many shareholders who can buy or sell stock on the open market. Stocks are bought and sold in financial markets called stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Corporate Structure While the exact organization varies from firm to firm, all corporations have the same basic structure. The owners&ndash;the stockholders&ndash;elect a board of directors. The board of directors makes all the major decisions of the corporation. It appoints corporate officers such as the chief executive officer or president. These officers run the corporation and oversee its operations. Corporate officers, in turn, hire managers and employees, who work in various departments such as finance, sales, research, marketing, and production. SUMMARIzE A publicly held corporation has Advantages of Incorporation Incorporation, or forming a corporation, offers advantages to both stockholders and the corporation itself. These advantages include limited liability for owners, transferable ownership, ability to attract capital, and long life. Advantages for Stockholders The primary reason that entrepreneurs choose to form a corporation is to gain the benefit of limited liability. Individual stockholders do not carry personal responsibility for the corporation&apos;s actions. They can lose only the amount of money they have invested in the business. If a corporation is sued and loses the case, it must pay the money award, but the assets of individual stockholders cannot be touched. Corporations usually also provide owners with more flexibility than other forms of ownership. Shares of stock are easily transferable.

What effect do you think Internet trading has had on the stock market? stockholders can easily sell their stock to others and get money in return. That is not the case with other forms of business organization. Advantages for Corporations The corporate structure also presents advantages for the firm itself. Corporations have more potential for growth than other business forms. By selling shares on the stock market, corporations can raise large amounts of capital. Corporations can also raise money by borrowing it. They do this by selling bonds. A bond is a formal contract issued by a corporation or other entity that includes the promise to repay borrowed money with interest at fixed intervals. Because ownership is separate from the running of the firm, corporate owners&ndash;that is, stockholders&ndash;do not need any special managerial skills. Instead, the corporation can hire various experts&ndash;the best financial analysts, the best engineers, and so forth. Corporations also have the advantage of long life. Because stock is transferable, corporations are able to exist longer than simple proprietorships or even partnerships. Unless it has stated in advance a specific termination date, the corporation can do business indefinitely. RECALL How do corporations raise capital? Disadvantages of Incorporation Corporations do have some disadvantages, including expense and difficulty of start-up, double taxation, potential loss of control by the founders, and more legal requirements and regulations. Difficulty and Expense of Start-Up Businesses that wish to incorporate must first file for a state license known as a certificate of incorporation, or corporate charter. The application includes crucial information such as corporate name, statement of purpose, length of time that the business will run (usually “for perpetuity,” or without limit), founders&apos; names and addresses, where business is based, method of fundraising, and rules for management. Once state officials review and approve the application, they grant the corporation its charter. Then the corporation organizes itself to produce and sell a good or service. Corporate charters can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to create. Though most states allow people to form corporations without legal help, few experts would recommend this shortcut. Double Taxation The law considers corporations legal entities separate from their owners. Corporations, therefore, must pay taxes on their income. 5.3 Corporations 189 ]]></text>

Bounce to Activate Chart Corporate earnings are taxed a second time as well. When corporations determine their profits, they often choose to pay a share of those profits to stockholders in payments called dividends. These dividends count as income for the stockholder, and the stockholder must pay personal income tax on them. This double taxation keeps many firms from incorporating. When stockholders sell shares, they must compare the selling price to how much they paid for them. If the selling price is higher, they have earned what is called a capital gain. That gain is also taxed. Some owners form limited liability corporations (LLCs). These businesses have the advantage of limited liability for owners, which all corporations enjoy. They also have tax advantages because the firm does not pay corporate income tax. Loss of Control The original owners of a corporation often lose control of the company. Corporate officers and boards of directors, not owners, manage corporations. These managers do not always act in the owners&apos; best interests. They might be more interested in protecting their own jobs or salaries today than in making difficult decisions that would benefit the firm tomorrow. More Regulation Corporations face more regulations than other types of businesses. They must hold annual meetings for stockholders and keep records of all business transactions. Publicly held corporations are required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is a federal agency that regulates the stock market. Corporations must also abide by government regulations that affect the use of business property. For example, a corporation that opens a new factory in a city must abide by the zoning laws of that city. It must also make sure that the factory meets regulations designed to ensure that employees work in a safe environment. It must make sure that the factory abides by laws that regulate the safe handling of industrial waste.

Bounce to Activate Illustration Corporate Mergers Corporations can grow very large. One way to grow is to raise money by selling stocks or bonds. Corporations may also grow by merging, or combining, with another corporation. The three kinds of mergers are horizontal mergers, vertical mergers, and conglomerates. Horizontal Mergers In a horizontal merger, two or more firms competing in the same market with the same good or service join together. In 2013, Office Depot, an office-supply store, merged with OfficeMax, another office-supply store. This was a horizontal merger. Two firms might choose to merge if the newly established firm would result in economies of scale or would otherwise improve efficiency. The federal government watches horizontal mergers carefully. The resulting single firm might gain monopoly power in its market. If that is the case, the government might try to block the merger in court. Judges then listen to arguments and read evidence to decide whether to allow the merger. Vertical Mergers In a vertical merger, two or more firms involved in different stages of producing the same good or service join together. A vertical merger can allow a firm to operate more efficiently. A vertically combined firm can control all phases of production, rather than relying on the goods or services of outside suppliers. Sometimes firms take this step out of fear that they may otherwise lose crucial supplies. Antitrust regulators become concerned when firms in the same industry merge vertically, especially if supplying firms suffer. Most vertical mergers do not substantially lessen competition, however. Some companies grow larger through a combination of horizontal and vertical mergers. Conglomerates Sometimes firms buy other companies that produce totally unrelated goods or services. When three or more unrelated businesses are involved, this combination is called a conglomerate. In a conglomerate, no one business earns the majority of the firm&apos;s profits. The government usually allows this kind of merger because it does not result in decreased competition.

In other words, working together, the individuals help one another. Cooperatives are based on several principles, which include: &bull; voluntary and open membership; &bull; democratic control of the organization by its members; &bull; sharing of contributions and benefits by members. Cooperatives enjoy some tax benefits. Like all businesses, cooperatives have earnings. But since they are not corporations, cooperatives do not pay income tax on their earnings as long as they handle those earnings in certain ways. At least 20 percent must be paid out to members. Members, of course, must then pay personal income taxes on that money. The cooperative invests as much as 80 percent of its earnings to maintain or expand its operations. Cooperatives, or co-ops, are found in many industries, from farming and energy to healthcare and child care. They fall into three main categories: consumer cooperatives, service cooperatives, and producer cooperatives. Any group of consumers or producers with common social or economic goals can band together to form a cooperative. Consumer Cooperatives Retail outlets owned and operated by consumers are called consumer cooperatives. They are also known as purchasing cooperatives. Consumer cooperatives sell merchandise to their members at reduced prices. By purchasing goods in large quantities, these cooperatives can obtain goods at a lower cost. They then pass the savings on to members by setting prices low. Examples of consumer cooperatives include discount price clubs, compact disc or book clubs, some health food stores, and housing cooperatives. Some co-ops charge an annual fee for membership. Others require members to work a small number of hours to maintain membership. For example, your health food store may require you to work 20 hours per month to remain in the cooperative. Consumer co-ops range in size from small buying clubs to Fortune 500 businesses. Service Cooperatives Cooperatives that provide a service rather than goods are called service cooperatives. Some service co-ops offer discounted insurance, banking services, healthcare, legal help, or baby-sitting services. Credit unions, or financial cooperatives, are a special kind of service cooperative. People deposit money in these institutions. The credit unions then use those funds to lend money to members at reduced rates.

These co-ops allow members to focus their attention on growing crops, raising livestock, and catching fish. The co-ops, meanwhile, market these goods for the highest prices possible. In a recent year, producer cooperatives sold more than $235 billion worth of crops, livestock, and seafood. These groups are involved in marketing dairy products, grain, beef and chicken, fish, and many other products. Some co-ops have more than a million members. RECALL How do members benefit from each type of cooperative? Nonprofits Some institutions function much like business organizations but do not operate for the purpose of generating profit. For that reason, they are called nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit organizations have no owner. They are often run by a board of directors. Nonprofits are usually in the business of providing some benefit to the public. Examples include museums, public schools, the American Red Cross, hospitals, adoption agencies, churches, synagogues, YMCAs, and many other groups and charities. Almost all of them provide services rather than goods. The government exempts nonprofit organizations from income taxes. The government gives this tax break in order to encourage organizations to meet needs that for-profit businesses might not otherwise provide, such as food or shelter for those who cannot afford them. Nonprofits must meet certain requirements to qualify for this tax-exempt status. Nonprofits cannot issue stock, so any profits that they make cannot be distributed to stockholders. Profits have to be invested in the organization. The group must devote its activities exclusively to those that the Internal Revenue Service says will qualify. For instance, a charity must act only to help people, such as the poor or those disabled by illness or injury. An educational nonprofit, such as a private college, must devote itself to the advancement of learning. Some nonprofits are nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The International Committee of the Red Cross and Greenpeace are examples. NGOs are independent groups that raise money and use it to fund and carry out programs.

Other nonprofit organizations provide support to particular occupations or geographical areas. These include professional organizations, business associations, trade associations, and labor unions. Nonprofits have some limits on their political activity. Charities and religious groups, for instance, can meet with members of Congress to try to influence laws being considered. They cannot devote too much of their resources to this lobbying activity, however. Professional Organizations Some nonprofits are professional organizations that work to improve the image, working conditions, and skill levels of people in particular occupations. Examples of this kind of nonprofit include the National Education Association for public school, college, and university workers; the American Veterinary Medical Association for veterinary professionals; the American Bar Association for lawyers; and the American Management Association for business professionals. Professional organizations keep their members up-to-date on industry trends. Many of these organizations provide members with employment- related services such as job boards, training workshops, and networking opportunities. They also set codes of conduct that members are expected to follow. For example, the American Medical Association sets guidelines for certain kinds of advertising. It wants doctors to present a professional, authoritative, and caring image as they seek new patients. The American Bar Association does not favor law firms that advertise their services for personal injury complaints. Business Associations Organizations called business associations promote the collective business interests of a city, state, or other geographical area, or of a group of similar businesses. A city or state chamber of commerce, for instance, works with government officials to try to promote policies that will help businesses grow and thrive. Business associations may also address codes of conduct, just as professional associations do. Your local Better Business Bureau (BBB), sponsored by local businesses, is a nonprofit group. It aims to protect consumers by promoting an ethical and fair marketplace. Consumers who have complaints about the actions of a local business can take them to the BBB. Workers there will contact the business and try to work out a solution that satisfies both parties. ]]></text>

The American Marketing Association, for example, aims to improve the image of companies that sell goods and services. All kinds of industries, from publishing to food processing, enjoy the support of trade associations. Many of these nonprofits hire lobbyists to work with state legislatures and the U.S. Congress. Lobbyists provide legislators with information about an industry and try to influence laws that affect that industry. Trade associations also hold meetings that members can attend to improve their skills or learn about industry trends.

Over the past two decades, the U.S. economy has shifted from a manufacturing economy toward a service-producing economy. As jobs in industries such as technology and financial services have soared, the number of manufacturing jobs has dwindled. How do we know the direction of changes in the job market? Each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States Department of Labor surveys households to assemble information on the labor force. Economists define the labor force as all nonmilitary people who are employed or unemployed. Employment and Unemployment Economists consider people to be employed if they are 16 years or older and meet at least one of the following requirements: &bull; they worked at least one hour for pay in the past week; &bull; they worked 15 or more hours without pay in a family business, such as a farm or a family-owned store; and &bull; they held jobs but did not work due to illnesses, vacations, labor disputes, or bad weather. People who have more than one job are counted only once. In 2013, about 6.7 million people held more than one job.

To be counted as unemployed, then, a person either must have work lined up for the future, or must be actively searching for a new job. Some groups of people are considered to be outside the labor force. The BLS uses the term “discouraged workers” to describe people who once sought work but have given up looking for a job. They are not counted in employment statistics. In addition, full-time students, parents who stay at home to raise children, and retirees are not considered unemployed, and thus are not counted in employment statistics. Figure 5.1 summarizes the groups that make up the U.S. labor force. The Labor Market Today The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides answers to two important economic questions. First, it says how many people are in the labor force. Second, it tells us how many are employed and unemployed at any given time. You can find BLS data at the Web site for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS provides information about historical trends. For example, the percentage of the U.S. population in the labor force has increased from 59.2 percent in 1950 to 63.2 percent in 2013. The number of employed civilians in the United States in 2013 was close to 144 million. About 76 million of these workers were men. About 68 million were women. The BLS also reports the unemployment rate each month. Economists studying the health of the economy monitor these monthly unemployment figures. In July 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.6 percent. The highest unemployment rate from 1997 to 2007 was 6.3 percent in June of 2003. Beginning in 2008, however, the rate of unemployment in the United States began to rise. In just one year, the rate jumped from 5.8 percent in 2008 to a staggering 9.3 percent in 2009. Then, in 2010, it reached its highest number in nearly 30 years, peaking at 9.6 percent. Since that time, however, it has been slowly but steadily decreasing. In November of 2013, it stood at 6.6 percent.

    <page pageNumber="266"> <text><![CDATA[ Occupational Trends The job market does not stay the same all the time. It grows as the nation&apos;s economy and population grow. The jobs that make up the job market also change. New technologies or new industries bring new jobs to life&ndash;and cause others to fade. Shifts in the job market reflect major shifts in what our economy produces. You can better understand these changes by looking at them in a historical context. A Changing Economy At its founding, the United States was a nation of farmers. Most people had few job opportunities beyond the corn, wheat, cotton, and tobacco fields. In the 1800s in the North, however, this focus on agriculture gradually yielded to the Industrial Revolution. The coming of the machine age energized the economy and created new jobs in textile mills, shoe factories, and other new manufacturing enterprises. By the early decades of the 1900s, heavy manufacturing had become the powerhouse of the U.S. economy. New corporate empires were born: John D. Rockefeller&apos;s Standard Oil in 1863; Andrew Carnegie&apos;s steelworks in the 1870s; Henry Ford&apos;s automobile company in 1903. These huge firms employed thousands of workers. The mid-twentieth-century boom in electronics&ndash; led by radio and television&ndash;produced a new surge of factory jobs. Employment growth centered in the Northeast and Midwest, in companies such as General Electric, Westinghouse, Carrier, and Goodyear. In the 1970s, the revolution in personal computers opened another new horizon for employment. As computer use continues to rise, the demand for computer-related occupations continues to grow. In this “Information Age,” even some traditional jobs, from trucking to farming to car sales, now require some computer skills. By the early 2000s, over half of American workers reported using computers on the job. More than a quarter of all workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and construction industries used computers. Fewer Goods, More Services The spread of computers is not the only change that has transformed the American economy. In the past one hundred or so years, the United States has shifted from a manufacturing economy to a service economy. Our production of services is increasing faster than our production of goods. (See Figure 5.2.) In 2005, five workers produced services for every one who produced goods. The service sector includes financial services, banking, education, and online services. Effects of International Competition While the number of service jobs has increased, the United States has lost manufacturing jobs.

Late 1800s Steel-producing factories and other new industries energize the economy. Mid 1900s Factories meet a demand for electronic devices such as radios and television. 2000s Handheld devices such as cell phones and “mini-computers” are in full use. >> In a little over 200 years, industry in the United States has changed dramatically. Analyze Information What 50-year period do you think has seen the most change and innovation, and why? 1970s Personal computers are produced, opening up new opportunities for employment. 17.7 million Americans worked in manufacturing industries. Fifteen years later, the number had fallen to 14.2 million. Many workers have been laid off due to plant closings or moves, too little work, or the replacement of jobs by new technology. These conditions can be the result of outsourcing, in which companies contract with another company to do a specific job that would otherwise be done by a company&apos;s own workers. Most companies will outsource work in some way. In the past, limits on the mobility of capital and labor meant that most goods sold in the United States were made by American workers in American factories. Today, capital and labor can be easily moved from place to place&ndash;and even from country to country. The movement of some of a company&apos;s operations, or resources of production, to another country is known as offshoring. American firms can build factories and hire workers in countries where wages and other costs are lower. American stores can buy a wide range of goods made in foreign countries to sell in the United States. As less-skilled manufacturing jobs moved overseas, the Americans who had filled these jobs had to find new work. Many went back to school or entered job training programs to gain new skills. These shifts in demand for workers are another example of supply and demand in operation. Demand for skilled service workers is rising, so wages for skilled workers go up. These higher wages persuade more people to train for these jobs to meet the demand. Meanwhile, as demand for manufacturing workers drops off, there is a surplus of these workers who find that they must become more skilled in order to compete in the job market. In recent years, businesses have looked abroad not only for factory workers, but also for the labor of highly skilled workers. By the early 2000s, companies increasingly looked offshore for computer engineers, software programmers, and other high-skilled jobs. This trend has affected other fields, such as auto design and some medical services, as well. RECALL Why do companies engage in offshoring? The Changing Labor Force Not only have jobs changed; workers have also changed. In the 1950s, a typical American worker was a white man who had graduated from high school and had found a secure 40-hour-a-week job where he probably hoped to stay until retiring at age 65. Not anymore. Today, more women and members of minority groups are in the workforce. In addition, someone entering the workforce can expect to have four or five different jobs during his or her working life. 5.5 The Labor Force 201 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="268"> <text><![CDATA[ College Graduates To get jobs, people must have human capital&ndash;the education, training, and experience that make them useful in the workplace. More and more, a high school diploma alone is not enough to prepare a person for financial success. To get&ndash;and succeed in&ndash;a job, people need more education. Getting a good education, however, requires money, time, and effort. Higher earnings compensate these workers for their advanced- training costs. Economists offer two explanations for the connection between educational advancement and higher wages. The theory that education increases efficiency of production and thus results in higher wages is called the learning effect. The statistics in Figure 5.3 support this theory. They show that college-educated workers have a higher median weekly income than high-school dropouts. Income continues to increase as people gain even more education. People with doctorates and professional degrees, such as doctors and lawyers, earn more than people with bachelor&apos;s degrees. Another theory about the relationship of education to wages is called the screening effect. This theory suggests that the completion of college signals to employers that a job applicant is intelligent and hard-working. The skills and determination necessary to complete college may also be useful qualities for employees to have. According to this theory, a college degree does not increase productivity, but simply identifies people who may be good employees because of their perseverance and innate skills. Women at Work The changing face of the labor force can be seen at your local bank. A few decades ago, men greeted customers at the tellers&apos; windows and served as loan officers. Today, most bank tellers and many loan officers are women. Women have also taken a greater role in national defense and in police and fire departments across the country. These changes over the past several decades are clearly shown in labor statistics numbers. In 1960, almost 38 percent of women belonged to the labor force. By 2012, that rate was nearly 58 percent. The increase may be due to several factors. One is that women were encouraged to pursue a higher education and add to their human capital. By increasing their human capital, they increased their potential earnings. With the expectation of earning more, more women entered the workforce. In addition, as more and more jobs become available in the service sector of the economy, fewer jobs call for physical strength. Instead, jobs require brainpower and personal skills, placing men and women on equal footing.

Analyze Graphs By about how much did the number of part-time workers change between 2008 and 2009? In recent times, economists believe that women are being affected by the same economic problems as men, including layoffs and offshoring. Nevertheless, for women in their prime working years, there appears to be little change in employment. In 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 69 percent of women ages 25 to 54 were employed. This was down from 74.9 percent in 2000. Temporary Workers In another important trend, more and more businesses are replacing permanent, full-time workers with part-time and temporary workers. These temporary and part-time jobs are known as contingent employment. Some temporary workers come from “temp” agencies. These are companies that have a pool of experienced workers who can be hired out to organizations on a short-term basis. The organization that needs the workers pays the temp agency. The agency, in turn, pays the worker a share of that fee, keeping the rest to cover expenses and profit. Other temporary workers are hired directly by firms as contract workers, people hired for a specified time period or to complete a certain task. Contingent employment is becoming more common even in occupations that had been very secure jobs. For example, some software engineers and attorneys are now hired as contract workers. When the workers complete their part of the project they were hired for, they are released. These highly skilled workers are generally well paid, with some earning as much as permanent workers. Experts have identified several reasons for the increased use of temporary employees. &bull; Flexible work arrangements allow firms to easily adjust their workforce to changing demand for their output. At times of reduced demand, they can easily lay off temporary workers or reduce workers&apos; hours instead of paying employees who are idle. When business picks up, companies can rehire whatever workers they need. &bull; Temporary workers in many industries are paid less and given fewer benefits (if any) than permanent, full-time workers. Thus, hiring more temporary workers cuts costs. &bull; Discharging temporary workers is easier and less costly than discharging regular, permanent employees. Many employers give full-time employees severance pay of several weeks&apos; worth of wages or salary when they lay off workers. They do not have to make these payments to temporary workers. &bull; Some workers actually prefer these flexible arrangements to traditional, permanent jobs. The market, then, reflects their preferences. On the other hand, BLS studies show that a majority of temporary workers would prefer permanent jobs. 5.5 The Labor Force 203 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="270"> <text><![CDATA[ The Impact of Foreign-Born Workers One topic that has received much attention in recent years is the impact of foreign-born workers on the labor force. In 2005, foreign-born workers numbered about 22 million people, nearly 15 percent of all workers in the United States. Many immigrant workers are able to become permanent residents. Some foreign-born workers are guest workers. They are allowed to live and work in the United States only temporarily. Companies that want to hire guest workers must show that they cannot meet their labor needs from native-born workers and that using guest workers will not lower the wages of native-born workers. If companies can prove this, the government gives them permission to bring in guest workers. Guest workers hold jobs in high-tech industries that demand highly skilled workers, and also in lower-skilled work such as agricultural labor. The impact of immigrants on the labor force is hotly debated. Some analysts say that immigrant workers hold down the wages of Americans. This effect shows supply and demand at work. As more immigrants enter the country, they increase the supply of workers. The demand of employers for workers does not necessarily increase, though. With greater quantity supplied than quantity demanded, employers can pay less for their workers as the market reaches a new equilibrium. The result, say critics of immigration, is that American-born workers see their wages drop. They also face stiffer competition for jobs. Other analysts say that immigrant workers fill an important role in the economy. First, they say, lower- skilled immigrant workers do jobs that Americans are unwilling to do because the wages are low. As a result, important work gets done that would not be done otherwise. Second, because immigrants take those jobs, the companies that hire them can charge less for their goods or services, which benefits everyone. ChECK UNdERSTANdINg How is the screening effect beneficial to employers? Wages and Benefits Trends Labor economists study not only who is in and out of the workforce, but how they are doing in terms of earnings and benefits. Today, the picture is mixed. Real Wages Down American workers enjoy higher wages than those in many other countries. In recent decades, though, the paychecks of American workers actually have been shrinking. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that median weekly earnings rose from $232 in 1979 to $770 in 2013.

    <page pageNumber="271"> <text><![CDATA[ there has been no actual increase. To make a better comparison, economists make calculations to hold the value of the dollar constant. This takes away the effect of inflation&ndash;the rise of prices over time. In constant 1982–1984 dollars, median wages actually declined, from a value of $335 per week in 1979 to $332 in 2013. In other words, real weekly wages have fallen about $3 in 34 years. Why have average real wages decreased in the last couple of decades? One reason, as you have read, is that greater competition from foreign companies has decreased the demand for workers. Deregulation of many domestic industries, such as trucking, air travel, and telecommunications, may have forced firms to cut employees&apos; wages as competition has intensified. The increased use of temporary work has also held down wages. Cost of Benefits For many workers, benefits such as pensions and health insurance are a significant share of total compensation. This share rose fairly steadily during the 1900s and early 2000s. By 2005, employer-provided benefits added $7.87 an hour to the cost of workers. Benefits now make up nearly 30 percent of workers&apos; compensation. This adds up to a large cost for employers&ndash;especially since benefits like health insurance are becoming more expensive. Social Security and Medicare taxes are included in these benefits, since they are used to pay benefits to retired and disabled workers. Most workers know that Social Security taxes are deducted from their paychecks each month. Did you know that employers pay a matching amount? Thus, workers and employers share this cost. In addition, Social Security and Medicare tax rates have risen substantially in recent decades, causing further increases in employers&apos; benefits costs. Employers are finding that these rising benefits costs increase the cost of doing business and thus cut into their profits. As a result, some types of contingent employees, such as independent contractors, become an attractive labor resource for companies because these workers do not have to be paid benefits. Offshoring and outsourcing also help firms to cut their expenses. If benefits costs continue to rise, companies will be pressured to pursue these steps to a greater extent. Those responses may prove unpopular with workers.

What people earn for what they do is largely a matter of how many people are willing and able to do the job and how much that job is in demand. Like eggs or airplanes or pet iguanas, labor is a commodity that is bought and sold. In a free market economy, the market finds its own equilibrium price for labor. In a mixed economy, the government also plays a role. Employment or unemployment in a labor market depends on how closely the demand for workers&ndash;the number of available jobs&ndash;meets the supply of workers seeking jobs. Let&apos;s examine how supply and demand operate in labor markets. Labor Demand The demand for labor comes from private firms and government agencies that hire workers to produce goods and services. In most labor markets, dozens, or even hundreds, of firms compete with one another for workers. Demand for labor is called a derived demand, because it is derived, or set, by the demand for another good or service. In this case, that other demand is the demand for what a worker VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

In a competitive labor market, workers are usually paid according to the value of what they produce. For example, competition among restaurants results in a wage for cooks that reflects the cook&apos;s productivity. Productivity of labor is the quantity of output produced by a unit of labor. The productivity of a cook&apos;s labor, for example, can be measured as the cost of a meal. Suppose that most of the restaurants in a city pay $12 an hour for cooks and that each cook generates $20 an hour in revenue for the restaurants. The possibility of profit will attract other entrepreneurs to open restaurants. Competition will push up the wage for cooks. As a result, cooks will be paid close to the value of their productivity of labor. Now look at the demand curve for labor, shown in Figure 5.4. Notice that it is negatively sloped, reflecting the law of demand. The higher the price of labor, the smaller the quantity of labor demanded by employers. Restaurants are more likely to hire more cooks at $12 an hour than at $16 an hour, because the lower cost means they can earn more profits on each cook&apos;s labor. Labor Supply The supply of labor comes from people willing to work for wages. As the graph in Figure 5.5 shows, the supply curve is positively sloped, reflecting the law of supply. In other words, the higher the wage, the larger the quantity of labor supplied. This is logical. It simply means that the higher the wage for a job, the greater the number of people who will be attracted to that job. A higher wage for cooks encourages people who would choose other occupations to acquire the training required to become a cook. Equilibrium Wage We know that at market equilibrium, the quantity of a good supplied will equal the quantity demanded. Economic factors&ndash; the supply of labor and the demand for it&ndash;combine to determine an equilibrium price. Because the equilibrium price makes the quantity that suppliers want to sell equal to the quantity that demanders want to buy, there is a tendency for the price or quantity not to change. That stability applies to the equilibrium price in one market, though. These factors may be different in different parts of the country, or at different times. The equilibrium wage is the wage rate, or price of labor services, that is set when the supply of workers meets the demand for workers in the labor Labor Demand 20 16 12 8 4 80 160 240 320 400 Worker-hours per week 0 Hourly wage (dollars) >> Figure 5.4 The graph shows a demand curve for restaurant cooks.

At equilibrium, there is no pressure to raise or lower wages. How do these theories affect how much you should expect to earn working in a pet store or a grocery store next summer? It depends on supply and demand in your area. If stores do not hire many additional workers during the summer and a lot of teenagers want to work, the wage will be relatively low. On the other hand, if stores want to hire a lot of teenagers and few teens want to work, the wage will be higher. ExPLAIN What determines the equilibrium wage of labor? Labor and Skills Why do lawyers earn more money than carpenters, and carpenters more than cashiers? Wages vary according to workers&apos; skill levels and education, as well as according to supply and demand. Jobs are often categorized into four skill levels: &bull; Unskilled labor requires no specialized skills, education, or training. Workers in these jobs usually earn an hourly wage. They include dishwashers, messengers, janitors, and many farmworkers.

Bounce to Activate Chart 208 TOPIC 5 Business and Labor &bull; Semi-skilled labor requires minimal specialized skills and education, such as the operation of certain types of equipment. Semi-skilled workers usually earn an hourly wage. They include lifeguards, word processors, short-order cooks, and many construction and factory workers. &bull; Skilled labor requires specialized abilities and training to do tasks such as operating complicated equipment. Skilled workers need little supervision, yet usually earn an hourly wage. They include auto mechanics, bank tellers, plumbers, firefighters, chefs, and carpenters. &bull; Professional labor demands advanced skills and education. Professionals are usually white-collar workers who receive a salary. Professionals include managers, teachers, bankers, doctors, actors, professional athletes, and computer programmers. Labor supply and demand can create a significant difference in pay scales for workers with various skills. For example, the labor market for medical doctors is relatively high compared to the market for construction workers. Because the supply of doctors is relatively low and the demand is relatively high, there is a high equilibrium wage. By comparison, the supply of construction workers is high relative to the demand for them. Hence, the equilibrium wage for construction workers would be much lower than that for doctors. Doctors and other highly educated workers&ndash;and those with extensive training and experience&ndash;enjoy demand for their services that is high relative to the supply, leading to higher earnings. The demand for workers with less education and training tends to be lower relative to the supply, so their earnings are lower. Experienced workers are desirable because they tend to be more productive than those newer to that job. Another reason that earnings vary is differences in working conditions. The level of danger in doing a job, the physical or emotional stress involved, and the location of the work can all change the equilibrium wage. Economic studies have shown that jobs with high accident and fatality rates pay relatively high wages. Workers who do dangerous jobs require compensation for the risk they take. Thus, there is a higher equilibrium wage rate for dangerous jobs, as shown in Figure 5.7. ExPRESS IdEAS CLEARLy How do education, training, and experience affect wages? ]]></text>

Analyze Graphs How do the demand curves in the two graphs compare? What can you conclude? Discrimination in the Labor Market As we have seen, wages for a particular job should end up at the equilibrium price of labor for that job. However, some people are paid less because of the social group they belong to. For instance, in the past, women and members of minority groups often received lower wages than white male workers for the same work. This practice is wage discrimination. Some employers defended wage discrimination against women by claiming that men needed the money to support families, while women were simply working to earn extra cash. Discrimination against minority workers reflected racial and ethnic prejudice in society. In recent decades, national or state legislators have tried to end these practices by passing laws prohibiting wage discrimination. Laws Against Wage Discrimination In the 1960s, the United States Congress passed several anti- discrimination laws that prevent companies from paying lower wages to some employees based on factors that are not related to skill or productivity, like gender or race. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 required that male and female employees in the same workplace performing the same job receive the same pay. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited job discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or nationality. (Religious institutions and small businesses are exempt from the law.) The Civil Rights Act also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the provisions of the law. Workers who feel they have been discriminated against can complain to the EEOC, which will investigate the matter. If necessary, the commission can take companies to court to force them to comply with the law. Pay Levels for Women Despite protections, women still earn less than men. This earnings gap has persisted over time. Historically, it has been the result of three factors: &bull; “Women&apos;s work.” Women have historically been discouraged from entering certain high-paying professions, such as medicine, law, and corporate management. Instead, they have been encouraged to pursue careers such as teaching, nursing, and clerical work. With so many women seeking work in these occupations, the labor supply has been generally high. As you know, a large supply of labor tends to produce a relatively low equilibrium wage. &bull; Human capital. Overall, women have had less education, training, and experience than men. This lack of human capital makes women&apos;s labor, in economic terms, less 5.6 Labor and Wages 209 ]]></text>

As a result, fewer women are eligible for the higher-paying, traditionally male-dominated jobs in fields such as engineering. &bull; Women&apos;s career paths. Even today, some employers assume that female employees are not interested in career advancement. This perception can be a roadblock for women in the workplace. The challenges many women face in trying to balance child-rearing and a career adds to this perception. Much progress has been made in creating job opportunities for women. Yet some qualified women still find that they cannot receive promotions to top- level jobs. This unofficial barrier that sometimes prevents women and minorities from advancing to the top ranks of organizations that are dominated by white men is called a glass ceiling. Pay Levels Across Society On average, members of minority groups tend to receive lower pay than whites do. Part of the wage gap has been caused by a history of racial discrimination. On average, whites have had access to more education and work experience, enabling them to develop skills that are in demand. Nondiscrimination laws, in part, are designed to give minority workers improved access to education and job opportunities so they can develop more human capital and lessen the wage gap. (See Figure 5.8.) The entire economy benefits when all workers have a higher level of skill and can be more productive. dESCRIbE How has the government tried to end wage discrimination? Additional Factors Affecting Wages In addition to laws forbidding discrimination, several other factors can affect wages. These include minimum wage laws, workplace safety laws, employer actions, and labor unions. Minimum Wage Laws In 1938, Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act. This law created a minimum wage&ndash;the lowest amount employers could lawfully pay for most types of work&ndash;and required employers to pay overtime for work beyond 40 hours a week. Many states also have their own minimum wage laws. Because of these laws, employers may be forced to pay more than the equilibrium wage for unskilled labor. Supporters of the minimum wage argue that it helps the poorest American workers earn enough to support themselves. Opponents say that artificially increasing the price of labor actually causes a decrease in quantity demanded.

    <page pageNumber="277"> <text><![CDATA[ individual employees will earn more, but companies will hire fewer of them. Safety Laws The federal government created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1970 to establish standards for safer working conditions. OSHA policies were issued in an effort to save lives, prevent injuries, and protect the health of workers in the private sector. All laws requiring certain minimum levels of safety also could have an impact on wages. If a law or policy increases safety at work, it may also decrease wages because workers are willing to work for lower wages when jobs are safer. By holding down wages, the law lowers an employer&apos;s costs. Of course, the employer will usually have to spend money to comply with safety regulations, which may more than offset the employer&apos;s savings from any wage reduction. Employers Respond to Wage Levels Employers may also take actions to try to affect wage levels. For example, a company might try to cut labor costs by substituting machines for people. In other words, employers can replace human capital with physical capital. Take furniture making, for example. In countries where labor is relatively cheap, furniture may be handmade by workers. In the United States, where labor is relatively expensive, manufacturers have substituted sophisticated machinery for more expensive human labor. Another increasingly common substitution involves customer service call centers, where automated answering services have replaced live telephone operators to direct incoming calls. Other examples of substituting physical capital for human capital include automated teller machines (ATMs), which take the place of bank tellers, and mechanized assembly lines, which can eliminate the need for some manufacturing workers. These technological advances have greatly reduced the number of employees that banks and manufacturing companies hire. Even if firms cannot use technology to replace labor, they may be able to reduce their labor costs in other ways. For instance, companies may outsource jobs to other parts of the world where labor is more plentiful and therefore cheaper. They may also choose to hire temporary workers.

Although labor unions are becoming less of a force in the American economy, workers might decide to join a union and press for higher pay. A labor union is an organization of workers that tries to improve working conditions, wages, and benefits for its members. One of the key goals of unions is to get wage increases for their members. As you will learn, unions allow workers to negotiate wage levels as a group rather than having to deal individually with employers. Their combined bargaining power is sometimes more effective at persuading employers to raise wages. Nationally, union members do tend to earn higher wages than nonunion workers in similar jobs. In 2012, the median weekly earnings for workers represented by unions were about $200 higher than the median weekly earnings for nonunion workers. That amounts to a difference of $5 an hour for a 40hour workweek. Some economists argue that unions depress the wages of nonunion workers. They offer this reasoning: 1. Unions press employers to raise their members&apos; wages. 2. When wages go up, the quantity of labor demanded goes down. Thus, the number of union jobs decreases. 3. As union jobs are cut, more workers are forced to seek nonunion jobs. 4. An increase in the supply of nonunion workers causes the wage rate for nonunion jobs to fall. In addition, some unions have engaged in featherbedding, negotiating labor contracts that keep unnecessary workers on the company payroll. A notable example of this practice occurred in the railroad industry. In the early days of railroads, a “cabooseman” had to ride at the back of the train to operate a rear brake that stopped the train. Yet even after design changes allowed the engineer at the front of the train to operate rear brakes, unions managed to keep caboosemen on the payroll. These workers received full wages and benefits for doing nothing. People who support unions counter that without the ability to organize, workers have little power compared to that of employers. Unless workers join together, they say, employers can dictate wage levels and working conditions. Since they can usually find replacement workers, their employees might have little real choice. In a later Lesson, you will learn more about the history of unions in the United States. You will also learn about the advantages and disadvantages of unions.

Shifts in the U.S. economy, however, have had a major impact on unions. The loss of manufacturing-sector jobs and the increased number of women in the workplace have been major factors contributing to the steep decline in union membership over the past 50 years. As you read earlier, wages are determined by the forces of supply and demand. Competition among firms keeps a worker&apos;s wages close to his or her level of productivity. In general, workers who command the highest wages are those with specialized skills and those who are in short supply. What about employees who feel that they are paid too little, work too many hours, or labor in unsafe conditions? What can these employees do? One option is to seek better wages and working conditions with a different employer. Many economists, in fact, argue that a competitive labor market helps prevent low pay and dangerous working conditions, because workers will leave companies with these characteristics to work elsewhere.

Many American workers have tried to gain some control over their wages and working conditions by forming labor unions. They reason that an individual worker does not have the power to change how an employer acts but that by banding together, workers can win gains from employers. In 2012, only about 11 percent of workers in the United States belonged to a labor union. In the past, though, unions had a strong influence on the nation&apos;s economy. In order to understand the role of labor unions today, we will look at how labor unions rose to power. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS Why do workers join labor unions? The History of the Labor Movement The union movement took shape over the course of more than a century. It faced many obstacles along the way, including violence and legal challenges from companies. Working Conditions in the 1800s Labor unions arose largely in response to changes in working conditions brought on by the Industrial Revolution in the early and mid-1800s. The spread of manufacturing in this period introduced factory work to the United States. By today&apos;s standards, this work was not enviable. In garment factories, iron plants, and gunpowder mills, laborers worked 12-to 16-hour days, 7 days a week, for meager wages. Working conditions were poor. Men, women, and children as young as five years old operated machines so dangerous that many people lost fingers and limbs. Injured workers often lost their jobs. Today, many firms try to retain their most skilled workers by treating them well. In 1855, however, that was hardly the case. One factory boss bluntly summarized his attitude toward workers: I regard people just as I regard my machinery. So long as they can do my work for what I choose to pay them, I keep them, getting out of them all that I can. &ndash;manager of a textile mill in Fall River, Massachusetts, 1855 214 TOPIC 5 Business and Labor ]]></text>

Infer Why do you think the early years of the labor movement were marked by violence? Unions Take Hold As early as the 1790s, whispers of worker discontent grew into organized protests. Skilled workers began to form unions to protect their interests. The chief tool of these early unions was the strike, an organized work stoppage intended to force an employer to address union demands. Employers responded by firing and replacing workers who tried to organize. Workers could not find help in the courts because the courts treated unions as illegal. An important leader in the early years of the United States labor movement was Samuel Gompers. The young cigarmaker rose within union ranks in New York City, focusing on three goals: higher wages, shorter hours, and safer work environments. In 1886, he founded the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Employer Resistance Attempts to unionize brought swift responses from employers. Viewing strikers as threats to free enterprise and social order, companies identified and fired union organizers. They forced workers to sign so-called yellow-dog contracts, in which workers promised not to join a union. (Yellow was slang for “cowardly.”) Companies also used court orders called injunctions to force striking employees back to work. Some companies hired their own militias to harass union organizers or fight striking workers. A Thriving Movement As the nation struggled through the Great Depression in the 1930s, Congress passed a number of measures that favored unions. The expansion of workers&apos; rights in the 1930s contributed to a new rise in union strength. Membership grew, reaching about 35 percent of the nation&apos;s non-farm workforce in the 1940s. Unions became a dominant force in many industries. They controlled the day-to-day operations of activities from shipbuilding to garbage collection to steel production. Unions amassed billions of dollars in union dues to cover the costs of union activities including organizing, making political donations, and providing aid to striking workers. RECALL Why did union membership rise in the 1930s? The Decline in Labor Union Membership As they grew, some unions began to abuse their power. Some sought to preserve outdated and inefficient production methods in order to protect jobs. As you read earlier, some unions managed to preserve job positions that were unnecessary&ndash; called “featherbedding”&ndash;in order to keep more members employed.

The reputation of unions suffered further because of their links to organized crime. Corrupt crime bosses gained a foothold in many local unions and used union funds to finance illegal operations. “Right-to-Work” Laws In an effort to curb union power, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This act allowed states to pass right-to-work laws, measures that ban mandatory union membership. Today, most right-to-work states are in the South, which has a lower level of union membership than other regions. Right-to-work laws may be one of several reasons for a decline in union membership in recent decades. By 2005, union membership had dropped to about 8 percent of the labor force. Today, unionism in the United States is far more limited than in many other countries. Decline of Traditional Strongholds One theory suggests that structural changes in the U.S. economy have caused union membership to decline. For example: &bull; Unions have traditionally been strongest among blue-collar workers. These workers perform manual labor, often in a manufacturing job, and earn an hourly wage. The decline of manufacturing activity, shown in Figure 5.9, has caused union jobs to disappear. &bull; Unions are weakest among white-collar employees. A white-collar worker is someone in a professional or clerical job who usually earns a weekly salary.While white- collar workers generally do not belong to unions, workers in the public sector are an exception. Unionization among government workers has increased in recent decades. This growth of union membership has partially made up for losses in the private sector. Some people object when public- sector workers like teachers go on strike. Members of these unions argue that, just as in the private sector, these unions are needed to promote the interests of their workers. &bull; Certain manufacturing industries, such as automobiles, steel, and textiles, have traditionally employed large numbers of union workers. These industries have been hurt by foreign competition in recent years, and automation, including the use of robots, has increased. As a result, many industries have laid off union workers, which has cut into union strength. As you saw earlier, the percentage of workers belonging to unions has fallen in recent years.

Analyze Information How has this change affected union membership? &bull; The rising proportion of women in the labor force (see Figure 5.10) also has affected union membership, since women have been less likely to join unions. &bull; Seeking to reduce their production costs, some industries have relocated from the Northeast and Midwest to the South, which has historically been less friendly to unions. Reduced Need for Unions Another theory for union decline is that other institutions now provide many of the services that had been won in the past through union activity. For example, the government has passed laws setting workplace safety standards and a shorter workweek. It provides unemployment insurance and Social Security. More nonunionized employers offer benefits such as medical insurance. ChECK UNdERSTANdINg What are three explanations for the decline in union membership? Labor and Management A union gains the right to represent workers at a company when a majority of workers in a particular work unit, such as a factory, vote to accept the union. After that, the company is required by law to bargain with the union in good faith to negotiate an employment contract. The Bargaining Process Picture a room and, on each side of a table, a team of lawyers and trained negotiators determined to get what they want&ndash;or at least part of it. This is collective bargaining, the process in which union and company management meet to negotiate a new labor contract. Union contracts generally last two to five years and can cover hundreds of issues. The resulting contract spells out each side&apos;s rights and responsibilities for the length of the agreement. Generally the union comes to the bargaining table with certain goals that set the agenda for collective bargaining talks. Let&apos;s examine those goals. Wages and benefits.The union negotiates on behalf of all members for wage rates, overtime rates, planned raises, and benefits. In seeking higher wages, the union is aware that if wages go too high, there may be consequences. If the workers succeed in getting higher wages and benefits, the company will have higher costs, which can reduce its competitiveness in the free market. If the company can&apos;t compete with other companies, it runs the risk of bankruptcy. As a result, the company may lay off workers to reduce costs. Working conditions.Safety, comfort, worker responsibilities, and many other workplace issues are negotiated and written into the final contract. Job security.One of the union&apos;s primary goals is to secure its members&apos; jobs, so the contract spells out the conditions under which a worker may be fired. If a union member is discharged for reasons that the 5.7 Labor Unions 217 ]]></text>

The union contract specifies how such grievances are handled. The procedure usually involves hearings by a committee of union and company representatives. Strikes When a contract is about to expire, or when the union is negotiating its first agreement with a company, the negotiators can wind up in tough late-night bargaining sessions. Most of the time, the parties manage to reach an agreement. But when a deadlock occurs, tensions escalate. The union may ask its members to vote to approve a strike. A strike is the union&apos;s ultimate weapon. A strike, particularly a lengthy one, can cripple a company. Some firms can continue to function by using managers to perform key tasks. They may hire workers who do not belong to the union, called “strikebreakers.” If a company can withstand a strike, it is in a good bargaining position. Most firms, however, cannot produce goods and services without their union workers. A long strike can also be devastating to workers, since they do not get paid while they are not working. Many unions do make some payments to their members during a strike, funded by the dues the union has collected. These payments can U.S. Work Stoppages, 1950–2010 help workers, but they are generally much smaller than what the members would have earned while working. It may seem as though workers strike frequently since strikes are often front-page news when they do occur. In fact, the collective bargaining process usually goes smoothly, with few work stoppages due to strikes. As shown in the graph in Figure 5.11, the number of work stoppages in the United States has declined sharply over time. In 2010, there were only 11 major work stoppages across the entire nation. Outside Help Reaching Settlements If a strike continues for a long time, the two sides sometimes call in a third party to help settle the dispute. They might agree to mediation, a settlement technique in which a neutral person, the mediator, meets with each side to try to find a solution that both sides will accept. A mediator often can help each side understand the other&apos;s concerns, leading to an agreement. However, the decision reached by the mediator is nonbinding&ndash;that is, neither side is required to accept it. If either side rejects the mediator&apos;s decision, the dispute could continue indefinitely. Sometimes, the talks will end up in arbitration. In this settlement technique, a neutral third party listens to both sides and then imposes a decision. 500 0 100 300 200 400 450 50 250 150 350 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Number of work stoppages Year SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics *work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers 2010 >> Figure 5.11 Work stoppages were once common, but they have become rare.

Lesson 1: Sole Proprietorships LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.5 A sole proprietorship is a business owned and managed by one person. Sole proprietorships are easy to start and end, face relatively few regulations, and give their owners full control of the business and its profits. Their owners, however, face personal liability&ndash;a risk of losing personal property if their businesses fail&ndash;and have less access to capital and less security than other kinds of business organization. Lesson 2: Partnerships and Franchises SS.912.E.1.5 Partnerships are businesses owned by people who agree on a division of responsibilities and profits. General partnerships involve personal liability, but some kinds of partnerships offer limited liability&ndash;a risk of losing only the amount invested. Partnerships are easy to start but risk conflicts among partners. Business franchises are businesses that pay a parent company for the exclusive right to sell the company&apos;s products in a location. They enjoy the company&apos;s assistance but have limited independence and profit potential. Lesson 3: Corporations SS.912.E.1.5 Corporations are businesses whose owners hold stock&ndash; or a share of ownership&ndash;and enjoy limited liability. Limited liability makes it relatively easy for corporations to raise capital. Laws and regulations, however, can make it difficult to start and run a corporation. Corporations may merge with other corporations. Some corporations are multinationals, which operate in more than one country. Lesson 4: Cooperatives and Nonprofits LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.5 Cooperatives are businesses owned by members and operated for their mutual benefit. Any earnings must be reinvested in the business or paid out to members. Nonprofit organizations are generally institutions that exist to provide a benefit to the public. A nonprofit has no owner and is often run by a board of directors. Nonprofits must reinvest any earnings and limit themselves to charitable activities. Lesson 5: The Labor Force SS.912.E.1.9 The labor force consists of all nonmilitary people who are employed or looking for work. The U.S. government tracks unemployment and changing employment trends, including the growth in outsourcing or offshoring. The labor force has become more female and less white. There has been a growth in part-time and temporary jobs, a decline in real wages, and a rise in the cost of benefits such as health insurance. Lesson 6: Labor and Wages SS.912.E.1.9 Wages respond like other prices to supply and demand. Wages depend in part on labor productivity, the quantity of output per unit of labor. For this reason, skilled and experienced workers command higher wages. Wage discrimination has hurt women and ethnic minorities, but laws exist to try to stop it. Other laws set minimum wages and safety standards. Labor unions aim to improve working conditions, wages, and benefits for members. Lesson 7: Labor Unions SS.912.E.1.9, SS.912.E.2.3 Labor unions began in response to the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s. They grew in the early 1900s but then lost popularity. Some states passed right-to-work laws that made it illegal to require union membership for a job. As a result, union membership shrank. Unions may strike, bargain with management, or seek mediation or arbitration to resolve conflicts. ]]></text>

Others think there is an unfair discrepancy between what CEOs make and what average workers make. DOCUMENT A This chart shows the ten U.S. companies with the highest ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in 2015. COMPANY TOTAL CEO COMPENSATION AVERAGE WORKER PAY RATIO A B C D E F G H I J 644 414 329 294 276 262 242 232 222 202 $7.29 million $26.44 million $18.43 million $21.97 million $3.25 million $28.14 million $17.95 million $19.37 million $27.7 million $22.8 million $11,324 $63,837 $55,975 $74,818 $11,789 $107,540 $74,287 $83,356 $124,959 $112,870 SOURCE: Bloomberg Business DOCUMENT B In 2014, Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen introduced a bill designed to narrow the gap between the incomes of CEOs and average workers. Executive compensation has skyrocketed while wages for regular workers have stagnated. Since the 1970s, compensation for regular workers has not kept up with increases in labor productivity. At the same time, executive pay continues to spiral upwards. Fifty years ago, the average CEO in the United States was paid 20 times more than the typical worker. Now that ratio is 300-to-1, far higher than in any other advanced economy. Adding insult to injury, average taxpayers subsidize excessive executive pay through corporate tax deductions. &ndash;House Budget Committee Democrats, “Fact Sheet: CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act” DOCUMENT C An expert on executive salaries discusses the controversy over CEO compensation. So, are CEOs overpaid compared to rank-and-file workers? If you read the media stories this year, and in previous years, you might conclude that they are. Some interest groups have determined that the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay is an appropriate measure of this problem.…. Most CEOs I&apos;ve dealt with are highly intelligent, have advanced degrees&ndash;often from one of the top universities in this country or elsewhere in the world&ndash; and have worked 70 or more hours per week for most of their career. Even if they weren&apos;t CEO of a public company, people with a background like that get paid much more than the average person…. I just read that U2 made $260 million in gross receipts on their 2005 tour. That&apos;s $3 million per show (about $1 million per hour). . . . I don&apos;t think most Americans want to impose an arbitrary cap on CEO pay any more than we want to impose a cap on U2&apos;s concert tour receipts because we know U2 would stop touring, and good CEOs would stop CEO-ing, and neither of those is to our benefit. &ndash;Fred Whittlesey, “The great overpaid CEO debate,”June 2006, http://news.cnet.com 22. Document A can best be used to support which statement? A. The gap between CEO pay and average worker salaries has widened over the years. B. CEOs of the largest American corporations earn more than they did in the past. C. The CEOs of American corporations are generally overpaid. D. In some companies, the CEO earns more than 200 times what the average worker earns. 23. The main idea of Document B is that A. incomes for average workers have grown quickly. B. incomes for CEOs have grown quickly. C. worker productivity has stagnated. D. corporate taxes are too high. 24.

It provides a means for comparing values of goods and services, and it serves as a store of value. Without it, we can&apos;t get the things we need and want. That&apos;s not the whole story of money, as you will see. In fact, money has functions and characteristics that you might never have thought about. If you were asked to define money, you would probably think of the coins and bills in your wallet. Economists define money in terms of its three uses. To an economist, money is anything that serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Money as a Medium of Exchange A medium of exchange is anything that is used to determine value during the exchange of goods and services. Without money, people acquire goods and services through barter, or the direct exchange of one set of goods or services for another. A barter agreement can be very useful when neither party in a transaction has money to pay for the other&apos;s services or goods. It can also lead to cost savings. For example, a baker&apos;s cost to bake a cake might be only $5. If he trades that cake for a $25 haircut, it is a savings to him of $20.

    <page pageNumber="295"> <text><![CDATA[ Similarly, the barber received a $25 cake for the time it took him to cut a head of hair. Barter is still used in many parts of the world, especially in traditional economies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is also sometimes used informally in the United States. For example, a person might agree to mow a neighbor&apos;s lawn in exchange for vegetables from the neighbor&apos;s garden. In general, however, as an economy becomes more specialized, it becomes too difficult to establish the relative value of items to be bartered. To appreciate how much easier money makes exchanges, suppose that money did not exist, and that you wanted to trade your portable DVD player for a brand-new mountain bike. You probably would have a great deal of trouble making the exchange. First, you would need to find a person who wanted to both sell the model of mountain bike you want and buy your particular DVD player. Second, this person would need to agree that your DVD player is worth the same as his or her bike. As you might guess, people in barter economies spend a great deal of time and effort exchanging the goods they have for the goods they need and want. That&apos;s why barter generally works well only in small, traditional economies. In those small economies, people can devote much of their time to exchanging goods. Now consider how much easier your transaction would be if you used money as a medium of exchange. All you would have to do is find someone who is willing to pay you $100 for your DVD player. Then you could use that money to buy a mountain bike from someone else. The person selling you the bike could use the $100 however he or she wished. By the same token, the person who pays $100 for your DVD player could raise that money however he or she wished. Because money makes exchanges so much easier, people have been using it for thousands of years. Money as a Unit of Account In addition to serving as a medium of exchange, money serves as a unit of account. That is, money provides a means for comparing the values of goods and services. For example, suppose you see a jacket on sale for $30. You know this is a good price because you have checked the price of the same or similar jackets in other stores. You can compare the cost of the jacket in this store with the cost in other stores because the price is expressed in the same way in every store in the United States&ndash;in terms of dollars and cents. Similarly, you would expect seeing a movie in a theater to cost about $8, a new DVD rental about $3.50, and so forth. Other countries have their own forms of money that serve as units of account. The Japanese quote prices in terms of yen, the Russians in terms of rubles, Mexicans in terms of pesos, and so forth. Money as a Store of Value Money also serves as a store of value. This means that money keeps its value if you decide to hold on to&ndash;or store&ndash;it instead of spending it. For example, when you sell your DVD player to purchase a mountain bike, you may not have a chance to purchase a bike right away. In the meantime, you can keep the money in your wallet or in a bank. The money will still be valuable and will be recognized as a medium of exchange weeks or months from now when you go to buy the bike. Money serves as a good store of value with one important exception. Sometimes economies experience a period of rapid inflation, or a general increase in prices. For example, suppose the United States experienced 10-percent inflation during a particular year. If you sold your DVD player at the beginning of that year for $100, the money you received would have 10 percent less value, or buying power, at the end of the year. Inflation would have caused the price of the mountain bike to increase by 10 percent during the year, to $110. The $100 you received at the beginning of the year would no longer be enough to buy the bike. >> Money makes the purchase of goods and services very easy.

You will read more about the causes and effects of inflation later. Define What does it mean to say that money serves as a store of value? The Six Characteristics of Money The coins and paper bills used as money are called currency. In the past, societies have also used an astoundingly wide range of other objects as currency. Cattle, salt, dried fish, furs, precious stones, gold, and silver have all served as currency at various times in various places. So have porpoise teeth, rice, wheat, seashells, tulip bulbs, and olive oil. These items all worked well in the societies in which they were used. None of them, however, would function very well in our economy today. Each lacks at least one of the six characteristics that economists use to judge how well an item serves as currency. These six characteristics are durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. Money Is Durable. Objects used as money must withstand the physical wear and tear that comes with being used over and over again. If money wears out or is easily destroyed, it cannot be trusted to serve as a store of value. Unlike wheat or olive oil, coins last for many years. In fact, some collectors have ancient Roman coins that are more than 2,000 years old. Although our paper money may not seem very durable, its rag (cloth) content helps $1 bills typically last at least a year in circulation. When paper bills wear out, the United States government can easily replace them. Of course, nothing is indestructible. Anyone who&apos;s ever had paper currency accidentally go through washing machine and dryer cycles knows that it doesn&apos;t always come out in “spendable” condition. One negative aspect of currency is that it can wear out in this way. Money Is Portable. People need to be able to take money with them as they go about their daily business. They also must be able to transfer money easily from one person to another when they use money for purchases. Paper money and coins are very portable, or easy to carry, because they are small and light. 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 $1 $1 25 25 25 25 25 25 $1 25 25 25 25 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 $5 $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 $1 $1 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 $1 HOW TO DIVIDE $5 >> One characteristic of money is that it is divisible into smaller amounts.

    <page pageNumber="297"> <text><![CDATA[ Money Is Divisible. To be useful, money must be easily divided into smaller denominations, or units of value. When money is divisible, people can use only as much of it as necessary for any exchange. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, people actually used parts of coins to pay exact amounts for their purchases. Spanish dollars, widely circulated in the American colonies, were often cut into as many as eight “bits,” or pieces. For this reason, these coins came to be called “pieces of eight.” Today, of course, if you use a $20 bill to pay for a $5 lunch, the cashier will not rip your bill into four pieces in order to make change. That&apos;s because American currency, like currencies around the world, consists of various denominations&ndash;$5 bills, $10 bills, and so on. There are circumstances in which money may not be conveniently divisible. All of the five-and ten- dollar bills in the world, for instance, would not do one much good at a parking meter that only accepts quarters. Money Is Uniform. Any two units of money must be uniform&ndash;that is, the same&ndash;in terms of what they will buy. In other words, people must be able to count and measure money accurately. Suppose everything were priced in terms of dried fish. One small dried fish might buy an apple. One large dried fish might buy a sandwich. This method of pricing is not a very accurate way of establishing the standard value of products, because the size of a dried fish can vary. Picture the arguments people would have when trying to agree whether a fish was small or large. A dollar bill, however, always buys $1 worth of goods. There Is a Limited Supply of Money. Suppose a society uses certain pebbles as money. These rare pebbles have been found only on one beach. One day, however, someone finds an enormous supply of similar pebbles on a different beach. Now anyone can scoop up these pebbles by the handful. Since these pebbles are no longer in limited supply, they are no longer useful as currency. In the United States, the Federal Reserve System controls the supply of money in circulation. By its actions, the Federal Reserve is able to keep just the right amount of money available. You&apos;ll read more about the Federal Reserve System later in this Topic. Money Is Acceptable as a Form of Payment. Finally, everyone in an economy must be able to take the objects that serve as money and exchange them for goods and services. When you go to the store, >> The characteristic of uniformity means that bills of the same denomination not only look exactly the same, but also buy the same amount of goods or services. Bounce to Activate Gallery why does the person behind the counter accept your money in exchange for a carton of milk or a box of pencils? After all, money is just pieces of metal or paper. Your money is accepted because the owner of the store can spend it elsewhere to buy something he or she needs or wants. There are, of course, instances when your currency may not be accepted. We&apos;ve all seen signs in smaller stores that read “No bills over $20,” or “No payment with pennies.” In general, though, in the United States, we expect that other people in the country will continue to accept paper money and coins in exchange for our purchases. This acceptability is one positive aspect of currency. IDENTIfy Who controls the supply of money in circulation in the United States? Sources of Money&apos;s Value Think about the bills and coins in your pocket. They are durable and portable.

The answer is that there are actually several possible sources of money&apos;s value, depending on whether it is commodity money, representative money, or fiat money. Commodity Money A commodity is an object. Commodity money consists of objects that have value in and of themselves and that are also used as money. For example, various societies have used salt, cattle, and precious stones as commodity money. The usefulness of objects is what gives them value. If not used as money, salt can preserve food and make it tastier. Cattle can be slaughtered for their meat, hides, and horns. Gems can be made into beautiful jewelry. Tobacco, corn, and cotton all served as commodity money in the American colonies. As you can guess, commodity money tends to lack several of the characteristics that make objects good to use as money. Take cattle, for example. Cows and bulls are not all that portable, or even durable. A cow is not divisible, at least not if you want to keep it alive. That&apos;s why commodity money only works in simple economies. As the American colonies developed more complex economic systems, tobacco and other objects were no longer universally accepted as money. The colonies needed >> These bills were issued during the American Revolution and could be redeemed for gold, silver, or Spanish currency. a more convenient payment system. They turned to representative money to meet their needs. Representative Money Representative money makes use of objects that have value solely because the holder can exchange them for something else of value. For example, if your brother gives you an IOU for $20, the piece of paper itself is worth nothing. The promise that he will do all of your chores for a month may be worth quite a lot, however. The piece of paper simply represents his promise to you. Early representative money took the form of paper receipts for gold and silver. Gold or silver money was heavy and thus inconvenient for customers and merchants to carry around. Each time someone made a transaction, the coins would have to be weighed and tested for purity. People therefore started to leave their gold in goldsmiths&apos; safes. Customers would carry paper ownership receipts from the goldsmith to show how much gold they owned. After a while, merchants began to accept goldsmiths&apos; receipts instead of the gold itself. In this way, the paper receipts became an early form of paper money. Colonists in the Massachusetts Bay Colony first used representative money in the late 1600s, when the colony&apos;s treasurer issued bills of credit to lenders to help finance King William&apos;s War. The bills of credit showed the exact amount that colonists had loaned to the Massachusetts government. Holders of these bills could redeem the paper for specie, or coins made of gold or silver. Representative money was not without its problems. During the American Revolution, the Second Continental Congress issued representative money called Continentals to finance the war against England. Unfortunately, few people were able to redeem these early paper currencies for specie because the federal government had no power to collect taxes. Until the Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789, the federal government depended on the states&apos; voluntary contributions to fill the treasury. As a result, the federal treasury held very little gold or silver to back the Continentals. People even began to use the phrase “not worth a Continental” to refer to something of no value. During the summer of 1780, this wretched “Continental” currency fell into contempt. As Washington said, it took a wagon-load of money to buy a wagon-load of provisions.

Early in 1789 its value had fallen to two cents and before the end of the year it took ten paper dollars to make a cent. A barber in Philadelphia papered his shop with bills. &ndash;John Fiske, The American Revolution, 1896 Later, the United States government issued representative money in the form of silver and gold certificates. These certificates were “backed” by gold or silver. In other words, holders of such certificates could redeem them for gold or silver at a local bank. The United States government thus had to keep vast supplies of gold and silver on hand to be able to convert all paper dollars to gold if the demand arose. Some silver certificates circulated until 1968, but for the most part, the government stopped converting paper money into silver or gold in the 1930s. Fiat Money If you examine a dollar bill, you will see George Washington&apos;s picture on one side. To the left of the portrait are the words “This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.” In essence, these words mean that this Federal Reserve Note is valuable because our government says it is. United States money today is fiat money. A fiat is an order or decree. Fiat money, also called “legal tender,” has value because a government has decreed that it is an acceptable means to pay debts. Furthermore, citizens have confidence that the money will be accepted. It remains in limited supply, and therefore valuable, because the Federal Reserve controls its supply. This control of the money supply is essential for a fiat system to work. If the money supply grows too large, the currency may become worthless due to inflation.

In this section, you will see how government regulations helped increase confidence in American banks. You will also see how American banking has developed over the years to meet the needs of a growing and changing population. During the first part of our nation&apos;s history, local banks were informal businesses that merchants managed in addition to their regular trade. For example, a merchant who sold cloth, grain, or other goods might allow customers to deposit money. The merchant would then charge a small fee to keep the money safe. These informal banks were not completely safe, however. If a merchant went out of business or invested deposits in risky schemes, customers could lose all of their savings.

    <page pageNumber="301"> <text><![CDATA[ Opposing Views of Banking After the American Revolution, the leaders of the new nation agreed on the need to establish a safe, stable banking system. Such a system was important for ensuring the economic growth of the new United States. The nation&apos;s leaders did not, however, agree on how that goal should be accomplished. The debate on banking between followers of Alexander Hamilton and followers of Thomas Jefferson was part of a larger political debate about the role of government in the young country. As you may remember from your study of American history, the Federalists believed that the country needed a strong central government to establish order. The Antifederalists favored leaving most powers in the hands of the states. These two groups viewed the country&apos;s banking needs quite differently. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, believed that a centralized banking system was a key to promoting industry and trade. After President Washington appointed Hamilton secretary of the treasury in 1789, Hamilton proposed a national bank&ndash;a bank chartered, or licensed, by the federal government. The bank would have the power to issue a national currency, manage the federal government&apos;s funds, and monitor other banks throughout the country. Developments in American Banking The Antifederalists, led by Thomas Jefferson, opposed this plan. They feared that the wealthy would gain control of the bank and use its resources to increase their power. They supported a decentralized banking system. In this system, the states would establish and regulate all banks within their borders. The First Bank of the United States At first, the Federalists were successful in creating a strong central bank. In 1791, Congress set up the Bank of the United States, granting it a 20-year charter to operate. The United States Treasury used the Bank to hold the money that the government collected in taxes and to issue representative money in the form of bank notes, which were backed by gold and silver. The Bank also supervised state-chartered banks, making sure they held sufficient gold and silver to exchange for bank notes should the demand arise. The Bank succeeded in bringing stability to American banking. However, opponents of the Bank charged that ordinary people who needed to borrow money to maintain or expand their farms and small businesses were being refused loans. In addition, the Antifederalists pointed out that the Constitution does not explicitly give Congress the power to create a national bank. Therefore, they argued, the Bank was unconstitutional.

Financial Chaos in America Once the Bank&apos;s charter expired, state banks (banks chartered by state governments) began issuing bank notes that they could not back with specie&ndash;gold or silver coins. The states also chartered many banks without considering whether these banks would be stable and creditworthy. Without any kind of regulation, financial confusion resulted. Prices rose rapidly. Neither merchants nor customers had confidence in the value of the paper money in circulation. Different banks issued different currencies, and bankers always faced the temptation to print more money than they had gold and silver to back. The Second Bank of the United States To eliminate this financial chaos, Congress chartered the Second Bank of the United States in 1816. Like the first Bank, the Second Bank was limited to a 20-year charter. The Second Bank slowly managed to rebuild the public&apos;s confidence in a national banking system. Nicholas Biddle, who became president >> During the years when there was no central bank, individual states and banks issued currency that was not backed by gold or silver, which led to financial confusion and chaos. of the Second Bank in 1823, was responsible for restoring stability. If Biddle thought that a particular state bank was issuing bank notes without enough gold and silver reserves, he would surprise the bank with a great number of its notes all at once, asking for gold or silver in return. Some state banks, caught without the necessary reserves, went out of business. Others quickly learned to limit how many notes they issued. Still, many Americans continued to be wary of the federal government&apos;s banking powers. They believed that the bank was a tool for the wealthy to further increase their wealth. Although the Supreme Court had ruled a national bank constitutional in 1819, President Andrew Jackson agreed with the bank&apos;s opponents. In 1832, Jackson vetoed its renewal. The Free Banking Era The fall of the Second Bank once again allowed state-chartered banks to flourish. For this reason, the period between 1837 and 1863 is known as the Free Banking, or “Wildcat,” Era. Between 1830 and 1837 alone, the number of state- chartered banks nearly tripled. As you might expect, the sheer number of banks gave rise to a variety of problems. Bank runs and panics State-chartered banks often did not keep enough gold and silver to back the paper money that they issued. This sometimes led to bank runs&ndash;widespread panics in which great numbers of people try to redeem their paper money at the same time. Many banks failed as a result, and public confidence plummeted. Wildcat banks Some banks were located on the frontier. They were called wildcat banks because people joked that only wildcats lived in such remote places. Wildcat banks were inadequately financed and had a high rate of failure. Fraud A few banks engaged in out-and-out fraud. They issued bank notes, collected gold and silver money from people who bought the notes, and then disappeared. Customers who were left holding the notes lost their money. Many different currencies State-chartered banks&ndash;as well as cities, private banks, railroads, stores, churches, and individuals&ndash;were allowed to issue currency. Notes of the same denomination often had different values, so that a dollar issued by the “City of Atlanta” was not necessarily worth the same as a dollar issued by the “City of New York.” The profusion of currencies made it easier to create counterfeits, or worthless imitations of real notes.

    <page pageNumber="303"> <text><![CDATA[ Stability in the Later 1800s By 1860, an estimated 8,000 different banks were circulating currency. To add to the confusion, the federal government played no role in providing paper currency or regulating reserves of gold or silver. The Civil War, which erupted in 1861, made existing problems worse. Currencies of the Civil War During the Civil War, both the Union and Confederacy needed to raise money to finance their military efforts. In 1861, the United States Treasury issued its first paper currency since the Continental. The official name of the currency was “demand notes,” but people called them greenbacks because they were printed with green ink. In the South, the Confederacy issued currency backed by cotton, hoping that a Confederate victory would ensure the currency&apos;s value. As the war weakened the Confederate economy, however, Confederate notes became worthless. National Banking Acts With war raging, the federal government enacted reforms aimed at restoring confidence in paper currency. These reforms resulted in the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864. Together, these Acts gave the federal government the power to charter banks, the power to require that banks hold adequate gold and silver reserves to cover their bank notes, and the power to issue a single national currency. The new national currency led to the elimination of the many different state currencies in use and helped stabilize the country&apos;s money supply. The Gold Standard Despite the reforms made during the Civil War, money and banking problems still plagued the country. In the 1870s, the nation adopted a gold standard&ndash;a monetary system in which paper money and coins had the value of certain amounts of gold. The gold standard set a definite value for the dollar, so that one ounce of gold equaled about $20. Since the value was set, people knew that they could redeem the full value of their paper money at any time. Now, the government could issue currency only if it had enough gold in the treasury to back the notes. Because of the limited supply of gold, the government was prevented from printing an unlimited number of notes. The gold standard thus fulfilled an essential requirement of a banking >> For many years, gold bars like these were used to establish the value of paper money and coins. system: a stable currency that inspires the confidence of the public.

Banking in the Early 1900s Reforms such as creating a single national currency and adopting the gold standard helped stabilize American banking. They did not, however, provide for a central decision-making authority. Such an authority could help banks provide funds for growth and manage the money supply based on what the economy needed. Continuing problems in the nation&apos;s banking system resulted in the Panic of 1907. Lacking adequate reserves, many banks had to stop exchanging gold for paper money. Several long- established New York banks failed, and many people lost their jobs because businesses could not borrow money to invest in future projects. 6.2 Changes in American Banking 237 ]]></text>

The Federal Reserve System, or Fed, served as the nation&apos;s first true central bank, or bank that can lend to other banks in times of need. It reorganized the federal banking system as follows: Federal Reserve Banks The system created as many as 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks throughout the country. All banks chartered by the national government were required to become members of the Fed. The Federal Reserve Banks are the central banks for their districts. Member banks&ndash;banks that belong to the Fed&ndash;store some of their cash reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank in their district. Federal Reserve Board All of the Federal Reserve Banks were supervised by a Federal Reserve Board appointed by the President of the United States. Short-Term Loans Each of the regional Federal Reserve Banks allowed member banks to borrow money to meet short-term demands. This helped prevent bank failures that occurred when large numbers of depositors withdrew funds during a panic. Federal Reserve Notes The system also created the national currency we use today in the United States&ndash;Federal Reserve notes. This allowed the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease >> As the Great Crash of 1929 sent stock prices tumbling, people flooded into the Wall Street area of New York City. the amount of money in circulation according to business needs. You will read more about the role of the Federal Reserve and how the system works today in the next Lesson. Banking and the Great Depression The Fed helped restore confidence in the nation&apos;s banking system. It was unable, however, to prevent the terrifying Great Depression&ndash;the severe economic decline that began with a stock market crash in 1929 and lasted more than a decade. During the 1920s, banks loaned large sums of money to many high-risk businesses. Many of these businesses were unable to pay back their loans. Because of hard times on the nation&apos;s farms, many farmers also failed to repay bank loans. Then, the 1929 stock market crash led to widespread bank runs as depositors in all parts of the country rushed to withdraw their money. The combination of unpaid loans and bank runs resulted in the failure of thousands of banks across the country. FDR Reforms After becoming President in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt acted to restore public confidence in the nation&apos;s banking system. Only days after his inauguration, Roosevelt closed the nation&apos;s banks. This “bank holiday” was a desperate last resort to restore trust in the nation&apos;s financial system. Within a matter of days, sound banks began to reopen. Later in 1933, Congress passed the act that established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC insures customer deposits if a bank fails. By 2008, each depositor&apos;s basic accounts in one bank were insured up to $250,000. In an attempt to increase the money supply, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that effectively ended the nation&apos;s use of the gold standard. In 1933, the United States nationalized all gold owned by private citizens and restricted individuals&apos; ability to redeem dollars for gold. The results of these actions were an increase in gold&apos;s value and a decrease in the value of the dollar. Going off the gold standard also allowed the Federal Reserve to maintain a money supply at adequate levels to support a growing economy. These actions, which meant that the nation moved away from representative money and moved toward a system of fiat money, helped the nation recover somewhat but did not end the Great Depression.

Bounce to Activate Gallery Two Crises for Banking As a result of the many bank failures of the Great Depression, banks were closely regulated from 1933 through the 1960s. The government restricted the interest rates banks could pay depositors and the rates that banks could charge consumers for loans. By the 1970s, bankers were eager for relief from federal regulation. The Savings and Loan Crisis In the late 1970s and 1980s, Congress passed laws to deregulate, or remove some restrictions on, several industries. Unfortunately, this deregulation contributed to a crisis in a class of banks known as Savings and Loans (S&Ls). Government regulation had protected S&Ls from some of the stresses of the marketplace. Thus, they were unprepared for the intense competition they faced after deregulation. There were other reasons for the crisis. During the 1970s, S&Ls had made long-term loans at low rates of interest. By the 1980s, interest rates had skyrocketed. This meant that S&Ls had to pay large amounts of interest to their depositors. The S&L industry made many risky loans in the early 1980s. Losses on bad loans forced many banks out of business. A few S&L managers also used S&L funds for their own personal gain. In 1989, Congress passed legislation that essentially abolished the independence of the savings and loan industry. This legislation expanded the insurance responsibilities of the FDIC. Financial “Meltdown,” Bailout, and “Recovery” In late 2006, problems in the U.S. banking industry began to threaten the housing market. The episode quickly spiraled into a full-fledged crisis, the most serious threat to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Beginning in the 1990s, U.S. banks decided to issue “subprime” loans to people seeking to purchase homes. The term “subprime” refers to loans that are made to borrowers with an unfavorable credit history. The higher interest rate banks charge because of the greater risk makes these loans more profitable. Banks began to market these loans aggressively to people who did not qualify for standard loans. Figure 6.1 shows the significant increase in subprime mortgages beginning around 2003. Bankers also devised ways of packaging these mortgages so that they could be sold off to investors. The value of these bundled mortgages, of course, depended on the ability of individual homeowners to repay their loans. The situation reached a crisis point when many homeowners had trouble repaying their loans. This led to a sharp rise in foreclosures, the seizure of property from borrowers who are unable to repay their loans. In addition, housing prices dropped 6.2 Changes in American Banking 239 ]]></text>

This condition became known as having an “underwater mortgage.” The increase in foreclosures hurt investors who had bought the mortgage bundles. A number of the nation&apos;s largest financial institutions that had invested heavily in subprime mortgages were forced into bankruptcy. The ripple effect was great, as hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers lost their jobs. Businesses and individuals found it difficult to get credit. By late 2008, the U.S. economy was on the edge of a financial catastrophe. It was officially in a recession. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, President George W. Bush, and U.S. lawmakers organized a $700 billion bailout of banks, automakers, and Wall Street financial firms. The money was used to help them avoid bankruptcy and to restart the flow of credit to businesses and individuals. In 2009, President Obama signed into law a $787 billion stimulus package, the largest in U.S. history. Approximately one third of the package was devoted to tax cuts; the rest went to spending increases. These included infrastructure projects and support for state healthcare obligations. Despite this, recovery has been slow. Five years after the meltdown, things in the U.S. economy had improved. The real estate market, for instance, was showing real and measurable signs of strengthening with the renewed confidence of buyers, sellers, and lenders. However, big banks were still much too large, excessive debt was still much too prevalent, and household savings rates were still far too low. The recovery was coming slowly and incrementally.

Banks had lent too much money and were in danger of failing. At the same time, the states had borrowed vast amounts of money to pay for the Revolutionary War. Lenders were reluctant to lend any more money to the new government. To regulate the banking system and finance the U.S. government, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton proposed a national bank. Washington&apos;s Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, strongly opposed such a bank, which he felt would violate the Constitution and threaten freedom. >>President George Washington&apos;s Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, led the opposition to a national bank. . . . I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground: That “all powers not delegated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to the people.” [XIIth amendment.] To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn around the powers of Congress, is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition. The incorporation of a bank, and the powers assumed by this bill [the bill to incorporate a bank], have not, in my opinion, been delegated to the United States, by the Constitution. I. They are not among the powers specially enumerated [listed]: for these are: [1.] A power to lay taxes for the purpose of paying the debts of the United States; but no debt is paid by this bill, nor any tax laid. . . . 2. “To borrow money.” But this bill neither borrows money nor ensures the borrowing it. . . . 3. To “regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the States, and with the Indian tribes.” To erect a bank, and to regulate commerce, are very different acts. He who erects a bank, creates a subject of commerce in its bills, so does he who makes a bushel of wheat, or digs a [dollar&apos;s worth of silver] out of the mines; yet neither of these persons regulates commerce thereby. To make a thing which may be bought and sold, is not to prescribe regulations for buying and selling. Besides, if this was an exercise of the power of regulating commerce, it would be void, as extending as much to the internal commerce of every State, as to its external. For the power given to Congress by the Constitution does not extend to the internal regulation of the commerce of a State . . . assess an argument Hamilton stated that the bank would allow the United States to borrow money. Jefferson argues that the bill to establish the bank violates the Constitution because the bill does not actually borrow money. How strong is this argument? II.

To lay taxes to provide for the general welfare of the United States, that is to say, “to lay taxes for the purpose of providing for the general welfare.” For the laying of taxes is the power, and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised. They are not to lay taxes . . . for any purpose they please; but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union. . . . 2. The second general phrase is, “to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers.” But they can all be carried into execution without a bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase. If has been urged that a bank will give great facility or convenience in the collection of taxes. Suppose this were true: yet the Constitution allows only the means which are “necessary,” not those which are merely “convenient” for effecting the enumerated powers. If such a latitude of construction be allowed to this phrase as to give any non-enumerated power, it will go to every one, for there is not one which ingenuity may not torture into a convenience in some instance or other . . . Therefore it was that the Constitution restrained them to the necessary means, that is to say, to those means without which the grant of power would be nugatory [worthless or invalid]. explain an argument How does Jefferson argue against using the word necessary too loosely? How does use of the word torture indicate his point of view? . . . Perhaps, indeed, bank bills may be a more convenient vehicle than treasury orders. But a little difference in the degree of convenience cannot constitute the necessity which the Constitution makes the ground for assuming any non-enumerated power. . . . It may be said that a bank whose bills would have a currency all over the States, would be more convenient than one whose currency is limited to a single State. So it would be still more convenient that there should be a bank, whose bills should have a currency all over the world. But it does not follow from this superior conveniency, that there exists anywhere a power to establish such a bank; or that the world may not go on very well without it. Can it be thought that the Constitution intended that for a shade or two of convenience, more or less, Congress should be authorized to break down the most ancient and fundamental laws of the several States; such as . . . the laws of monopoly? determine meaning How does Jefferson use the words necessary and convenient, and how does he refine the meanings of these words in this text? . . . The negative of the President is the shield provided by the Constitution to protect against the invasions of the legislature: 1. The right of the Executive. 2. Of the Judiciary. 3.

Thomas Jefferson and others spoke out against the idea of a national bank, which they believed violated the Constitution. Here is Hamilton&apos;s response to his critics. . . . Now it appears to [me] that this general principle is inherent in the very definition of government, and essential to every step of progress to be made by that of the United States, namely: That every power vested in a government . . . includes . . . a right to employ all the means requisite [needed] . . . which are not precluded [forbidden] by restrictions and exceptions specified in the Constitution, or not immoral, or not contrary to the essential ends of political society. . . . explain an argument What right does Hamilton say is included in all government powers? What limits are there to that right? The first of [Jefferson and Randolph&apos;s] arguments is, that the foundation of the Constitution is laid on this ground: “That all powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved for the States, or to the people.” . . . And it is affirmed, that the power of [creating] a corporation is not included in any of the enumerated [listed] powers. . . . It is not denied that there are implied well as express [stated] powers. . . It is conceded that implied powers are to be considered as delegated [granted] [to the government] equally with express ones. Then it >> George Washington&apos;s Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton follows, that as a power of [creating] a corporation may as well be implied as any other thing, it may as well be employed as an instrument or mean of carrying into execution any of the specified powers . . . The only question must be . . . whether . . . the corporation to be [created], has a natural relation to any of the acknowledged objects or lawful ends of the government. . . . explain an argument Why are implied powers important to Hamilton&apos;s argument in favor of the government&apos;s right to create a corporation? . . . [I]t is objected, that none but necessary and proper means are to be employed; and [Jefferson] maintains, that no means are to be considered as necessary but those without which . . . [government] power would be nugatory [worthless, invalid]. . . . It is certain that neither the grammatical nor popular sense of the term requires that construction. According to both, necessary often means no more than needful, requisite, incidental, useful, or conducive to. It is a common mode of expression to say, that it is necessary for a government or a person to do this or that thing, when nothing more is intended or understood, than that the interests of the government or person require, or will be promoted by, the doing of this or that thing. . .

The Federal Reserve in American History The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It has many important tasks, but the most prominent one is to act as the main spokesperson for the country&apos;s monetary policy. Monetary policy refers to the actions that the Fed takes to influence the level of real GDP and the rate of inflation in the economy. The role of a central bank in the U.S. economy has been hotly debated since 1790, when Federalists lined up in favor of establishing a central bank. The first Bank of the United States issued a single currency. It also reviewed banking practices and helped the federal government carry out its duties and powers.

    <page pageNumber="312"> <text><![CDATA[ Partly because of the impassioned debate over state versus federal powers, however, the first Bank lasted only until 1811. At that time, Congress refused to extend its charter. Congress established the Second Bank of the United States in 1816 to restore order to the monetary system. However, many people still feared that a central bank placed too much power in the hands of the federal government. Political opposition toppled the Second Bank in 1836 when its charter expired. A period of confusion followed. States chartered some banks, while the federal government chartered and regulated others. Banks had to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand. Reserves are deposits that a bank keeps readily available as opposed to lending them out. Reserve requirements&ndash;the amount of reserves that banks are required to keep on hand&ndash;were difficult to enforce, however, and the nation experienced several serious bank runs. The Panic of 1907 finally convinced Congress that it had to act. The nation&apos;s banking system needed to address two issues. First, consumers and businesses needed greater access to funds to encourage business expansion. Second, banks needed a source of Central Banks of the United States emergency cash to prevent depositor panics that resulted in bank runs. IDENTIfy MAIN IDEAS Why did some Americans oppose the idea of creating a central bank? The History of the Federal Reserve System Attempting to prevent problems such as the Panic of 1907, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The resulting Federal Reserve System, now often referred to simply as “the Fed,” consisted of a group of 12 independent regional banks. These banks could lend to other banks in times of need. Structural Weaknesses Revealed The Great Depression was exactly the situation Congress had hoped to avoid by creating the Federal Reserve System. The system did not work well in that economic crisis, however, because the regional banks each acted independently. Their separate actions often canceled one another out. For example, in 1929 and 1930, the Governors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Chicago wanted the Fed to lower interest rates. Many of the assets used to make business loans had lost value as 1800 1850 1900 1950 2000 1791–1811 First Bank of the United States 1816–1836 Second Bank of the United States 1914–Present Federal Reserve System >> After the end of the second national bank, it took many decades before Congress created a new central bank.

Analyze Information How can a central bank help achieve that goal? a result of the stock market crash. Lowering interest rates would address that problem by making more money available to banks. However, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was against lowering interest rates. Concerned about the growth of the stock market, the board favored a contractionary monetary policy&ndash;that is, a policy that did not promote rapid economic growth. They also restrained the New York board from taking strong action. Many economists believe that the failure of the Fed to act contributed to the deepening of the financial crisis. Strengthening the Fed In response to the ongoing depression, Congress adjusted the Federal Reserve&apos;s structure in 1935 so that the system could respond more effectively to future crises. These reforms created the Federal Reserve System as we know it today. The new Fed enjoyed more centralized power so that the regional banks were able to act consistently with one another while still representing their own districts&apos; banking concerns. One example shows how the new Fed helped fight a Depression- era crisis in a small Minnesota town. Picture this scene: Outside a bank in the town, a large crowd was growing frantic. A large number of withdrawals had badly depleted the bank&apos;s supply of cash. Inside the bank, a worried banker phoned the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis&ndash;200 miles away&ndash; and begged officials there to send him money. Fed officers snapped into action. They hired an airplane and loaded it with half a million dollars packed in satchels. Upon approaching the town the pilot guided the plane low over the main street to dramatize its arrival and then landed in a nearby field. From there the Fed officials were ceremoniously escorted into town by the police and the money was stacked along the bank&apos;s teller windows. The sight of all that money piled up inside the bank quelled the customers&apos; fears and saved the bank from failing. &ndash; “Born of a Panic: Forming the Federal Reserve System,” Federal Reserve Board, Minneapolis More Recent Fed Changes The Fed has continued to change since the Depression.

The Fed won, allowing it to act more independently in setting monetary policy. In 1980, a new law gave the Fed the authority to set reserve requirements for all banks, even those that are not members. In 1987 and the early 2000s, the Fed acted aggressively to try to reassure investors that it would support financial institutions in times of crisis. That determination was demonstrated in 2008, when the Fed played a leading role in responding to the financial crisis that arose. It made emergency loans to banks that needed funds, purchased large amounts of Treasury bonds, and even bought mortgage-related financial instruments. These actions helped reduce the impact of the financial crisis at that time. Descri be Why did the Fed fail to respond to the Great Depression? The Structure of the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve System is privately owned by the member banks themselves, but it is publicly controlled by the federal government. Like so many American institutions, the structure of the Federal Reserve System represents compromises between centralized power and regional powers. Figure 6.2 illustrates that structure. The Board of Governors The Federal Reserve System is overseen by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Board of Governors is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Its seven governors, or members, are appointed for staggered 14-year terms by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The terms are staggered to prevent any one President from appointing a full Board of Governors and to protect board members from day-to-day political pressures. Members cannot be reappointed after serving a full term. Geographical restrictions on these appointments ensure that no one district is overrepresented. The President also appoints, and the Senate confirms, the chair of the Board of Governors from among these seven members. Chairs serve four-year terms, which can be renewed.

The New York Reserve Bank has a small geographic area but the largest number of assets. Recent chairs of the Fed have been economists from the business world, the academic world, or government. They have a keen sensitivity toward public opinion and an ability to use the media to affect it. Alan Greenspan, a former head of an economics consulting firm and chair of the President&apos;s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), has been the most notable chair of the Fed in modern times. He took office in 1987 and served both Republican and Democratic administrations. After Greenspan resigned in 2006, President George W. Bush replaced him with Ben Bernanke, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers and a former professor of economics. Bernanke learned about monetary policy and the ideas of Milton Friedman as a graduate student. In 2013, President Barack Obama nominated Janet Yellen as the first female chair of the Federal Reserve System. Prior to her nomination, Yellen was the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the President of the Federal Reserve District Bank in San Francisco. Twelve Federal Reserve Banks The Federal Reserve Act divided the United States into 12 Federal Reserve Districts, as shown in Figure 6.3. One Federal Reserve Bank is located in each district, though it may have branches in other cities in the district as well. Each of these banks monitors and reports on economic and banking conditions in its district. Each Federal Reserve District is made up of more than one state. The Federal Reserve Act aimed to establish a system in which no one region could exploit the central bank&apos;s power at another region&apos;s expense. Congress regulates the makeup of each Reserve Bank&apos;s board of nine directors to make sure that the board represents many interests. The nine directors consist of three sets of three persons each. The first set of three represents commercial banks, and they are elected by the district&apos;s member banks. The member banks also elect the second set&ndash;three people who represent the interests of groups such as industry, commerce, labor, services, and consumers. The third set of directors is appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. These three represent the same broad public interests as the second group. The Board of Governors selects one of the nine directors to serve as chair of the Reserve Bank&apos;s board. Each board of directors appoints a president of the Reserve Bank, subject to approval by the Board of Governors. 6.3 The Federal Reserve System 249 ]]></text>

The remaining members are state-chartered banks that join voluntarily. Since 1980, all banks have equal access to Fed services, whether or not they are Fed members. These services include reserve loans to banks in need of short-term cash. Each of the approximately 2,400 Fed member banks contributes a small amount of money to join the system. In return, it receives stock in the system. This stock earns the bank dividends from the Fed at a rate of up to 6 percent. The fact that the banks themselves, rather than a government agency, own the Federal Reserve gives the system a high degree of political independence. This independence helps the Fed to make decisions that best suit the interests of the country as a whole. The Federal Open Market Committee The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes key monetary policy decisions about interest rates and the growth of the money supply in the United States. The committee meets about eight times a year in private to discuss the cost and availability of credit, for businesses and consumers, across the country.

All seven members of the Board of Governors sit on the FOMC, as do five of the 12 district bank presidents. The president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is a permanent member. The four other district presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. The Board of Governors holds a majority of the seats on the FOMC, giving it effective control over the committee&apos;s actions. After meeting with the FOMC, the chair of the Board of Governors announces the committee&apos;s decisions to the public. The Federal Reserve Banks and financial markets spring into action as they react to Fed decisions. IDENTIfy What is the role of each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks? The Fed&apos;s Roles: Serving the Government Your summer job is going great&ndash;you like the work, and it pays well. The trouble is, the paychecks are handed out just once a month, and you desperately need that first paycheck. Finally, the end of the month arrives, and you rush to your bank to cash your paycheck. But the bank teller has an unpleasant surprise for you. The bank will not credit the amount to your account until the paycheck clears. It will take at least two days, the teller says, for the check- clearing process to be completed.

For example, if you receive a check from the federal government and cash it at your local bank, it is the Federal Reserve that deducts the amount from the Treasury&apos;s account. The Federal Reserve also serves as a financial agent for the Treasury Department and other government agencies. The Fed sells, transfers, and redeems securities such as government bonds, bills, and notes. It also makes interest payments to the people holding these securities. The Treasury Department auctions off government bills, bonds, and notes to finance the many programs of the U.S. government.

It clears checks, safeguards bank resources, and lends funds to help banks that need to borrow in order to maintain their legally required reserves. It also coordinates the activities of a number of state and federal regulatory authorities. Clearing Checks Check clearing is the process by which banks record whose account gives up money and whose account receives money as a result of a customer writing a check. The Fed can clear millions of checks at any one time using high-speed equipment. Most checks clear within two days&ndash;a remarkable achievement when you consider that the Fed processes about 18 billion checks per year. Supervising Banking Practices To ensure stability of the banking system, the Federal Reserve monitors banks&apos; reserves. Each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks sends out bank examiners to check up on lending and other financial activities of member banks. As part of the Fed&apos;s role in supervising banks, the Board of Governors studies proposed bank mergers and bank holding company charters to ensure competition in the banking and financial industries. A bank holding company is a company that owns more than one bank. The Board of Governors 6.3 The Federal Reserve System 251 ]]></text>

Acting as Lender of Last Resort Under normal circumstances, banks lend each other money on a day-to-day basis, using money from their reserve balances. These funds are called federal funds. The interest rate that banks charge each other for these loans is the federal funds rate. Banks also borrow from the Federal Reserve, especially in financial emergencies such as recessions. The Fed acts as a lender of last resort, making emergency loans to commercial banks so that they can maintain required reserves. The rate the Federal Reserve charges for these loans is called the discount rate. The Fed&apos;s Expanded Role A serious financial crisis erupted in 2008. It began because many banks had made home loans that borrowers were unable to repay. As the crisis deepened, corporations and other borrowers could not obtain loans from banks, and the financial system ceased to function effectively. The Federal Reserve responded to this crisis by changing the size and scope of its involvement in the economy. When banks stopped lending each other money, the Fed fulfilled its role as lender of last resort. It also began purchasing assets, as total assets increased during 2008 from less than $1 trillion to over $2 trillion. Prior to the financial crisis, most of the Fed&apos;s assets consisted of government securities. To help the mortgage market through the financial crisis, the Fed bought mortgage-backed securities. In 2010, the Fed held over $1 trillion of these financial instruments. The Fed took two other significant steps during the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve worked with some central banks in other countries to create “swap lines.” In these arrangements, the Fed loaned dollars to the foreign banks for a short period of time. The foreign banks could lend those funds in their own countries but had to repay the Fed&ndash;with interest&ndash;in a specified time period. The second unusual measure was that the FOMC reduced the discount rate nearly to 0 percent in late 2008. This move aimed at lowering interest rates in the hopes of jump-starting the economy. The FOMC kept the rate at this extremely low level late into 2013. Monitoring Reserves United States banks operate under a fractional reserve system. Banks hold in reserve only a fraction of their funds&ndash;just enough to meet customers&apos; expected daily needs. Banks then lend their remaining funds, charging interest to earn returns.

Analyze Charts When was it cheaper to borrow money, in 2000 or 2010? Why? Each financial institution that holds deposits for customers must report daily to the Fed about its reserves and activities. The Fed uses these reserves to control how much money is in circulation. Conducting Bank Examinations The Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies also examine banks periodically to ensure that each institution is obeying laws and regulations. Examiners may make unexpected bank visits to ensure that banks are following sound lending practices. Bank examiners can force banks to sell risky investments or to declare loans that will not be repaid as losses. If examiners find that a bank has taken excessive risks, they may classify that institution as a problem bank and force it to undergo more frequent examinations. The Federal Reserve also protects consumers by enforcing truth-in-lending laws, which require lenders to provide full and accurate information about loan terms. Under a provision called Regulation Z, consumers receive useful information about retail credit terms, automobile loans, and home mortgages. IDENTIfy CENTRAL IDEAS Why does the Federal Reserve conduct bank examinations? The Fed&apos;s Roles: Regulating the Money Supply The Federal Reserve is best known for its role in regulating the nation&apos;s money supply. To do so, it uses several tools: setting the discount rate, setting reserve requirements, setting the federal funds rate target, and using open market operations to meet that target. Economists and the Fed watch several indicators of the money supply. M1 is a measure of the funds that are easily accessible or in circulation. M2 includes the funds counted in M1 as well as money market accounts and savings instruments. You will read more about these measurements in the next Lesson. The Fed compares various measures of the money supply with the likely demand for money to determine when and how to use these tools. The Demand for Money People and firms need to have a certain amount of cash on hand to make purchases&ndash;to buy groceries, supplies, clothing, and so forth. The more of your wealth you hold as money, the easier it will be to make these transactions. Of course, we can&apos;t earn interest on money that we hold as cash. As interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive to hold money as cash rather than 6.3 The Federal Reserve System 253 ]]></text>

That is, not investing when interest rates are high means you don&apos;t realize earnings you otherwise would realize. So, as interest rates rise, people and firms will generally keep their wealth in assets such as bonds, stocks, or savings accounts rather than in cash. The higher that interest rates are, the lower the demand for money. The final factor that influences money demand is the general level of income. As GDP or real income rises, families and firms keep more of their wealth or income in cash. Stabilizing the Economy The laws of supply and demand affect money, just as they affect everything else in the economy. Too much money in the economy leads to inflation. In inflationary times, it takes more money to purchase the same goods and services. It is the Fed&apos;s job to keep the money supply stable. Ideally, if real GDP grew smoothly and the economy stayed at full employment, the Fed would increase the money supply just enough to match the growth in the demand for money, thus keeping inflation low. It is difficult to predict economic effects. however. The Fed has to be careful in using monetary policy to regulate the money supply. IDENTIfy What is the effect of too much money in circulation?

They issue credit cards, make loans to businesses, and provide mortgages to prospective home buyers. They also manage automated teller machines that enable a person to deposit or withdraw money in almost any place on the globe. In this text, you&apos;ll learn more about electronic transactions, the fractional reserve system, and other aspects of banking today. You are familiar with paying for the items you need with currency&ndash;the bills and coins in your pocket. Currency is money. So are traveler&apos;s checks, checking account deposits, and a variety of other components. All of these components make up the United States money supply&ndash;all the money available in the United States economy. To more easily keep track of these different kinds of money, economists divide the money supply into several categories. The main categories are called M1 and M2. M1 As you can see from Figure 6.4, M1 represents money that people can gain access to easily and immediately to pay for goods VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="322"> <text><![CDATA[ and services. In other words, M1 consists of assets that have liquidity, or the ability to be used as, or directly converted into, cash. About 45 percent of M1 is made up of currency held by the public, that is, all currency held outside of bank vaults. Another large component of M1 is deposits in checking accounts. Funds in checking accounts are also called demand deposits, because checks can be paid “on demand,” that is, at any time. Until the 1980s, checking accounts did not pay interest. When they began paying interest, the Fed introduced a new component to measure M1, called other checkable deposits, to describe those accounts. Today this category is not as meaningful as it once was, since many checking accounts only pay interest if the balance is sufficiently high. Traveler&apos;s checks make up a very small part of M1. Unlike personal checks, traveler&apos;s checks can be easily turned into cash. M2 As you can see in Figure 6.5, M2 consists of all the assets in M1 plus several additional assets. These additional M2 funds cannot be used as cash directly but can be converted to cash fairly easily. M2 assets are also called near money. For example, deposits in savings accounts are included in M2. They are not included in M1 because they cannot be used directly in financial exchanges. M1 Components You cannot hand a sales clerk your savings account passbook to pay for a new backpack. You can, however, withdraw money from your savings account and then use that money to buy a backpack. Deposits in money market mutual funds are also included as part of M2. These are funds that pool money from a large number of small savers to purchase short-term government and corporate securities. They earn interest and can be used to cover checks written over a certain minimum amount, such as $250. IDENTIfy Which category of the money supply includes deposits in money market mutual funds? Functions of Financial Institutions Banks and other financial institutions are essential to managing the money supply. They perform many functions and offer a wide range of services to consumers.These services benefit both businesses and households, which is a term economists use to describe ordinary consumers Storing Money Banks provide a safe, convenient place for people to store money.

As you have already read, FDIC insurance protects people from losing their money if the bank is unable to repay funds. Saving Money Banks offer a variety of ways for people to save money. Four of the most common ways are savings accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Savings accounts and checking accounts are the most common types of bank accounts. They are especially useful for people who need to make frequent withdrawals. Savings accounts and most checking accounts pay interest at an annual rate. These accounts offer practically no risk, but the financial cost of them is that the interest rates are very low. Money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) are special kinds of savings accounts that pay a higher rate of interest than savings and checking accounts. Money market accounts allow you to save and to write a limited number of checks. Interest rates are not fixed; they can move up or down. CDs, on the other hand, offer a guaranteed rate of interest. Funds placed in a CD, however, cannot be removed until the end of a certain time period, such as one or two years. CDs, like savings anc checking accounts, have little risk, but customers who remove their money before that time pay a penalty for early withdrawal. Interest allows consumers to earn money from their savings when they maintain bank accounts or purchase CDs. For example, a person with $25,000 in a savings account with an annual interest rate of 3 percent will earn $750 in a year. Over time, these earnings will add up and increase savings. Consumers can use these savings to put a down payment on a house, pay for college, or fund their retirement. Savings are also helpful when something unforeseen, like a job layoff, happens. Making Loans Banks also perform the important service of providing loans. As you have read, the first banks started doing business when goldsmiths issued paper receipts. These receipts represented gold coins that the goldsmiths held in safe storage for their customers. They would charge a small fee for this service. In early banks, those receipts were fully backed by gold&ndash;every customer who held a receipt could be sure that the goldsmith kept the equivalent amount of gold in his safe. Gradually, however, goldsmiths realized that their customers seldom, if ever, asked for all of their gold on one day. Goldsmiths could thus lend out half or even three quarters of their gold at any one time and still have enough gold to handle customer demand. Why did goldsmiths want to lend 6.4 The Functions of Modern Banks 257 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="324"> <text><![CDATA[ 258 TOPIC 6 Money, Banking, and Financial Markets gold? The answer is that they charged interest on their loans. By keeping just enough gold reserves to cover demand, goldsmiths could run a profitable business lending deposits to borrowers and earning interest. A banking system that keeps only a fraction of its funds on hand and lends out the remainder is called fractional reserve banking. Like the early banks, today&apos;s banks also operate on this principle. The more money a bank lends out, and the higher the interest rate it charges borrowers, the more profit the bank is able to make. By making loans, banks help new businesses get started, and they help established businesses grow. When a business gets a loan, that business can create new jobs by hiring new workers or investing in physical capital in order to increase production. A business that gets a loan may also help other businesses grow. Suppose you and a friend want to start a window-washing business. Your business will need supplies, like window cleaner and ladders, so the companies that make your supplies will also benefit. They may even hire workers to expand their businesses. Banks also make loans to consumers. For example, banks lend money to people to purchase cars, which are expensive and difficult to pay for all at once. Consumers also borrow money from banks to purchase homes, make improvements to their homes, and pay for college. Banks earn money on the interest they charge to consumers. Bankers must, however, consider the security of the loans they make. Suppose borrowers default, or fail to pay back their loans. Then the bank may lose a large part, or even the entire amount, of the money it has loaned. Bankers, therefore, always face a tradeoff between profits and safety. If they make too many bad loans&ndash;loans that are not repaid&ndash;they may go out of business altogether. People who borrow money take on a lot of responsibility. They are obligated to pay the bank the amount of money they borrowed in a timely manner, usually on a monthly basis, plus interest. Borrowers who don&apos;t repay their loans or make late payments will see their credit scores suffer, have their property repossessed if they put collateral down for the loan, have their wages garnished to pay the loan, and possibly lose the ability to obtain loans in the future. Mortgages A mortgage is a specific type of loan that is used to buy real estate. Suppose the Lee family wants to buy a house for $250,000. They are unlikely to have the cash on hand to be able to pay for the house. Like almost all home buyers, they will need to take out a mortgage. $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K Customer A deposits $10,000 in Bank 1. Bank 1 can lend 80% of the money deposited, or $8,000. It holds 20%, or $2,000, in reserve and lends the rest to Customer B. From the original $10,000, three banks have lent out a total of $19,520, and placed $4,880 in their reserves. The reserves protect the banks against demands for withdrawals. Customer B spends the $8,000, which gets deposited in Bank 2. Bank 2 lends 80%, or $6,400, to Customer C and holds $1,600 in reserve. Customer C spends the $6,400, which gets deposited in Bank 3. Bank 3 then lends 80%, or $5,120, to Customer D A and holds $1,280 in reserve. 1 1 B 2 C 3 D $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K $10K HOWDOES THE FRACTIONAL RESERVE SYSTEM WORK? >> The Fed requires banks to keep a fraction of their funds on hand and lend the remainder to customers.

Analyze Graphs Why is the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage higher than the rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage? The Lees can afford to make a down payment of 20 percent of the price of the house, or $50,000. After investigating the Lees&apos; creditworthiness, their bank agrees to lend them the remaining $200,000 so that they can purchase their new house. Mortgages usually last for 15, 25, or 30 years. According to the terms of their loan, the Lees are responsible for paying back the loan, plus whatever interest the bank charges, in regular monthly payments over a period of 25 years. Buying a home can provide many benefits, but it also can come with costs. One benefit is stability. Unlike renters, homeowners with a fixed-rate mortgage can expect to pay the same amount every year for the duration of the loan. Because homes typically increase in value over time, people often make money when they sell their home. However, many home buyers have to use a large portion of their savings for a down payment. They also have less mobility than renters. For example, a renter who finds a new job in a different city will be able to relocate more easily than a homeowner. Credit Cards Another service that banks provide is issuing credit cards&ndash;cards entitling their owners to buy goods and services based on the owners&apos; promises to pay. How do credit cards work? Suppose you buy a sleeping bag and tent for $150 on May 3. Your credit card bill may not arrive until June. You do not actually pay for the gear until you pay that bill. In the meantime, however, the credit card issuer (often a bank) will have paid the sporting-goods store. Your payment repays the bank for the “loan” of $150. If you do not pay your credit card bill in full when you receive it, you will end up paying a high rate of interest on that loan. A positive aspect of credit cards is that they give people the ability to purchase goods they might not have been able to afford otherwise. For example, you might want to purchase $500 worth of gear for a camping trip next weekend. Because you won&apos;t have that amount of money in your checking account until you get paid in two weeks, you can use a credit card. Using a credit card will help build credit, which is needed for getting a loan to buy a car or house. A negative aspect of credit cards is that items purchased with credit cards sometimes wind up costing more than their price tag. If you purchased the camping gear with a card that had a 15 percent interest rate and you sent your credit card company $50 a month for 11 months, the total you would pay for the gear would be about $538. People who frequently make purchases with credit cards run the risk of incurring high debts that are difficult to pay back. 6.4 The Functions of Modern Banks 259 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="326"> <text><![CDATA[ Interest As you have read, interest is the price paid for the use of borrowed money. The amount borrowed is called the principal. Simple interest is interest paid only on principal. For example, if you deposit $100 in a savings account at 5 percent simple interest, you will make $5 in a year (assuming that interest is paid annually). Suppose that you leave the $5 in interest in the bank, so that at the end of the year you have $105 in your account&ndash;$100 in principal and $5 in interest. Compound interest is interest paid on both principal and accumulated interest. That means that in the second year, as long as you leave both the principal and the interest in your account, interest will be paid on $105. In Figure 6.6, you can see how an account paying compound interest grows over time. Making a Profit The largest source of income for banks is the interest they receive from customers who have taken loans. Banks, of course, also pay out interest on customers&apos; savings and most checking accounts. The amount of interest they pay out, however, is less than the amount of interest they charge on loans. The difference in the amounts is how banks cover their costs and make a profit. IDENTIfy What type of loan helps a person purchase a home? Compound Interest Types of Financial Institutions Several kinds of financial institutions operate in the United States. These include commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and credit unions. Commercial Banks Commercial banks, which traditionally served businesses, offer a wide range of services today. Commercial banks offer checking accounts, accept deposits, and make loans to businesses and to individuals. Some commercial banks are chartered by states and are regulated by state authorities and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). About one third of all commercial banks are national banks and are part of the Federal Reserve System. Commercial banks provide the most services and play the largest role in the economy of any type of bank. Savings and Loan Associations Savings and loan associations (S&Ls), which you read about in Text 2, were originally chartered to lend money for building homes during the mid-1800s. Members of S&Ls deposited funds into a large general fund and then borrowed enough money to build their own houses. Savings and loan associations are also called thrifts because they originally enabled “thrifty” working- class people&ndash;that is, people who were careful with their money&ndash;to save up and borrow enough to build $100.00 $105.00 $110.25 $121.55 $155.13 $197.99 1 2 3 5 10 15 $5.00 $5.25 $5.51 $6.08 $7.77 $9.90 $105.00 $110.25 $115.76 $127.63 $162.90 $207.89 YEAR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT INTEREST EARNED AT 5% PRINCIPAL AT END OF YEAR >> Figure 6.6 A $100 deposit, when compounded yearly at 5 percent, will more than double in value over 15 years.

Analyze Graphs About how many more commercials banks are there in the United States than savings banks? or buy their own homes. Over time, S&Ls have taken on many of the same functions as commercial banks. Savings Banks Mutual savings banks (MSBs) originated in the early 1800s to serve people who made smaller deposits and transactions than commercial banks wished to handle. Mutual savings banks were owned by the depositors themselves, who shared in any profits. Later, many MSBs began to sell stock to raise additional capital. These institutions became simply savings banks because depositors no longer owned them. Although savings banks were traditionally concentrated in the Northeast, they had an important influence on the national economy. In 1972, the Consumer&apos;s Savings Bank of Worcester, Massachusetts, introduced a Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) account, a type of checking account that pays interest. NOW accounts became available nationwide in 1980. Credit Unions Credit unions are cooperative lending associations usually established by and for particular groups, usually employees of a specific firm or government agency. Some are open to an entire community. Credit unions are commonly fairly small and specialize in consumer loans, usually at interest rates favorable to members. Some credit unions also provide checking account services. Finance Companies Finance companies make installment loans to consumers. These loans spread the cost of major purchases such as computers, cars, and large appliances over a number of months. Because people who borrow from finance companies more frequently fail to repay the loans, finance companies generally charge higher interest rates than banks do. IDENTIfy Which type of financial institution plays the largest role in the economy? Budgeting Consumers can benefit from a range of financial services. In order to take advantage of them, though, you need to be able to budget your money. Income and Expenses The first step in budgeting is figuring out your income and expenses. Add up all of your sources of income, whether from a job, allowance, or other sources. Next, add up your expenses. If you are not sure of these, keep a spending diary for a month. Every time you spend even a little money, note the amount you spent and what you spent it on in a notebook or a smart device. At the end of the month, create a list of categories 6.4 The Functions of Modern Banks 261 ]]></text>

Bounce to Activate Chart of spending, such as transportation, food, and entertainment. Assign every purchase to a category, and add up the amounts in each category. Now you know your expenses. Your monthly expenses should add up to less than your income. That way, you will be able to put aside savings. Savings provide a cushion when you face an unexpected expense, like a broken-down car or a sick pet. Savings can also provide a downpayment for a major purchase, such as a car or a house. If you spend more than your income, you will end up owing money, or in debt. When you are in debt, you have to pay interest on your debt. The interest expense leaves you with less to spend on the things you want and makes it harder to pay off the debt. If you spend more than your income, look at your categories of spending and decide where to cut back. A Credit Plan and Savings Budgeting to build up savings is also a key part of constructing a credit plan. A credit plan will help you to build a good credit record. With a good credit record, you will pay less in interest and have more money to spend on things you want when you need to borrow for a major purchase. The first step in creating a credit plan is budgeting. If you are already in debt, make sure to set aside enough of your income, after expenses, to pay off your debt as quickly as possible. Once you are out of debt, your next goal is to save. Figure out how much it would cost to cover all of your expenses for six months if you had no income. You should save at least enough to live on for six months, and preferably for a year, as a safety cushion. If you want to make a major purchase, you should save enough, in addition to that cushion, to cover a downpayment. Another key part of a credit plan is to budget enough every month to pay all of your bills, and to pay every bill on time, every month. Your credit record depends mainly on your record of on-time bill payment. Building Credit If you do not have a credit card yet, and you want to build your credit, the next step in a credit plan is to obtain a credit card and use it responsibly. That means making sure that any purchases on the card are within your budget, and paying the card off every month. To establish a credit record, you might need to get a secured credit card, with a deposit from your savings as security. You may also be able to obtain a first credit card if a parent cosigns the card, indicating that they will pay if you do not. But your goal is never to miss a payment so that you can obtain an unsecured credit card on your own to use responsibly. With careful budgeting and a credit plan, you will be able to achieve any goal that is within your means, such as paying for a home or a car, or even starting your own business.

The savings you put in the bank will grow with almost no risk to the principle. However, as this section points out, a properly timed investment can bring a much greater reward than the same money put away in savings. On the other hand, if your investment is wrongly placed or ill-timed, you may wish you had never taken the money out of the bank. In its most general sense, investment is the act of redirecting resources from being consumed today so that they may create benefits in the future. In more narrow, economic terms, investment is the use of assets to earn income or profit. One of the benefits of the free enterprise system is that it provides investment opportunities. Investment promotes economic growth and helps to create wealth. When people deposit money in a savings account in a bank, for example, the bank may then lend the funds to businesses. The businesses, in turn, may invest that money in new plants and equipment to give them the resources to increase production.

DESCRIbE What role does investment play in the free enterprise system? The Financial System In order for investment to take place, an economy must have a financial system. A financial system is the network of structures and mechanisms that allows the transfer of money between savers and borrowers. Financial Assets When people save, they are, in essence, lending funds to others. Whether they put cash in a savings account, purchase a certificate of deposit, or buy a government or corporate bond, savers obtain a document that confirms their purchase or deposit. These documents may be passbooks, monthly statements, bond certificates, or other records. Such documents represent claims on the property or income of the borrower. These claims are called financial assets, or securities. If the borrower fails to pay back the loan, these documents can serve as proof in court that money was borrowed and that commitments were made that were not fulfilled. Savers and Borrowers Figure 6.7 shows how the financial system brings together savers and borrowers, fueling investment and economic growth. On one side are savers&ndash;households, individuals, and businesses that lend out their savings in return for financial assets, such as the promise of regular interest payments. On the other side are investors&ndash;governments and businesses&ndash;who invest the money they borrow to build roads, factories, and homes. Investors may also use these funds to develop new products, create new markets, or provide new services. Interest allocates savings to its most productive use. The interest that savers earn is the reason why they save money in a bank or invest it, rather than spending it or holding cash. Financial institutions then invest those savings in businesses that use it productively to create more wealth. Long-term interest rates are higher than short term rates, which can also help use money productively. Without the higher rates, people might not be willing to invest money for long periods of time. When businesses can have that money for longer periods, they can use in productive ways that require more time, such as building new facilities or investing in equipment that may take a while to pay off.

Analyze Graphs How would you describe the trend in the percentage that Americans saved between 1975 and 2005? Financial Intermediaries Savers and borrowers may be linked directly. As you examine Figure 6.7, you will notice that borrowers and savers may also be linked through a variety of institutions pictured as “in between” the two. These financial intermediaries are institutions that help channel funds from savers to borrowers. They include the following: Banks, savings and loan associations (S&Ls), credit unions, and finance companiesBanks, S&Ls, and credit unions take in deposits from savers and then lend out some of these funds to businesses and individuals. Finance companies make loans to consumers and small businesses. Mutual funds A mutual fund pools the savings of many individuals and invests this money in a variety of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. Mutual funds allow people to invest in a broad range of companies in the stock market. Investing in this way is less risky than purchasing the stock of only one or two companies that might do poorly. Hedge funds A hedge fund is a private investment organization that employs risky strategies that often make huge profits for investors. These investors are generally wealthy and often are knowledgeable about investing. Because hedge funds are private, they have not been regulated by the SEC and have not had to reveal information about themselves to the public. Life insurance companies The main function of life insurance is to provide financial protection for the family or other people named as beneficiaries of the insured. Working members of a family, for example, may buy life insurance policies so that, if they die, money will be paid to survivors to make up for lost income. Insurance companies collect payments called premiums from the people who buy insurance. They lend out to investors part of the premiums that they collect. Pension funds A pension is income that some retirees receive after working a certain number of years or reaching a certain age. In certain cases, injuries may qualify a working person for pension benefits. Employers may set up pension funds in a number of ways. They may contribute to the pension fund on behalf of their employees, they may withhold a percentage of workers&apos; salaries to deposit in a pension fund, or they may do both. Employers set up pension funds to collect deposits and distribute payments. Pension fund managers invest those deposits in stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. Now that you know something about the types of financial intermediaries, you may wonder why savers don&apos;t deal directly with investors. The answer is that, in general, dealing with financial intermediaries 6.5 Investing 265 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="332"> <text><![CDATA[ offers three advantages. Intermediaries share risks, provide information, and provide liquidity. Sharing Risk As a saver, you may not want to invest your entire life savings in a single company or enterprise. For example, if you had $500 to invest and your neighbor was opening a new restaurant, would you give her the entire $500? Since it is estimated that more than half of all new businesses fail, you would be wise not to risk all of your money in one investment. Instead, you would want to spread the money around to various businesses. This would reduce your chances of losing your entire investment. This strategy of spreading out investments to reduce risk is called diversification. If you deposited $500 in the bank or bought shares of a mutual fund, those institutions could pool your money with other people&apos;s savings and put your money to work by making a variety of investments. In other words, financial intermediaries can diversify your investments and thus reduce the risk that you will lose all of your funds if a single investment fails. Financial intermediaries such as banks weigh risks when determining if it will be worthwhile to invest money in a given business venture. They will take a risk if the opportunity merits it. Because financial institutions diversify their investments, they can take risks that individuals would probably be unwilling to take. They can invest a portion of money into a risky venture, because they know that it could be a very profitable and productive use Types of Risk of the money. Financial intermediaries generally know more than individuals about potential risks and rewards of investments, so these institutions are more likely to invest in ventures that will have a productive outcome. Providing Information Financial intermediaries are also good sources of information. Your local bank collects information about borrowers by monitoring their income and spending. Finance companies collect information when borrowers fill out credit applications. Mutual fund managers know how the stocks in their portfolios, or collections of financial assets, are performing. As required by law, all intermediaries provide this and other information to potential investors in an investment report called a prospectus. The typical prospectus also warns potential investors that “past performance does not necessarily predict future results.” An investment that looks great today may fizzle tomorrow. As economic conditions change, an investment once considered safe may look very risky. By providing vital data about investment opportunities, financial intermediaries reduce the costs in time and money that lenders and borrowers would pay if they had to search out such information on their own. The information, however, is sometimes provided in lengthy documents with small type. So the careful investor must be knowledgeable and must study whatever information has been provided. You lend $20 to your cousin, who promises to pay you back in two weeks. When your cousin fails to pay you on time, you don&apos;t have money for the basketball tickets you had planned to buy. Your cell phone is worth $100. You need cash to buy concert tickets, so you decide to sell the phone. To convert your cell phone into cash on short notice, you have to discount the price to $75. Ricardo lends Jeff $1,000 for one year at 10 percent interest. If the inflation rate is 12 percent, Ricardo loses money. Borrowers may not pay back the money they have borrowed, or they may be late in making payments. You may not be able to convert the investment back into cash quickly enough for your needs. Inflation rates erode the value of your assets. You may have to pass up better opportunities for investment. Lili invests $100 in May&apos;s cleaning business, to be repaid at 5 percent interest one year later.

    <page pageNumber="333"> <text><![CDATA[ Providing Liquidity Financial intermediaries also provide investors with liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to convert an asset into cash. Suppose, for example, that you decide to invest in a mutual fund. Two years later, you need cash to pay your college tuition. You can get cash quickly by selling your shares in the mutual fund. Other investments are not so liquid. If you had purchased an investment- quality painting instead, you would need to find another investor who would buy the art from you. As you can see, financial intermediaries and the liquidity they provide are crucial to meeting borrowers&apos; and lenders&apos; needs in our increasingly complex financial system. IDENTIfy CENTRAL IDEAS Why do savers and investors generally work through financial intermediaries? Liquidity, Return, and Risk As you have read, most decisions involve trade-offs. For example, the trade-off for not going to a movie may be two additional hours of sleep. Saving and investing involve trade-offs as well. Liquidity and Return Suppose you save money in a savings account. Savings accounts are good ways to save when you need to be able to get to your cash for immediate use. On the other hand, savings accounts pay relatively low interest rates, about 2 to 3 percentage points below a certificate of deposit (CD). In other words, savings accounts are liquid, but they have a low return. Return is the money an investor receives above and beyond the sum of money that has been invested. What if, however, you unexpectedly inherit $5,000? You do not need ready access to those funds, since your part-time job pays your day-to-day expenses. If you are willing to give up some degree of ready access to your money, you can earn a higher interest rate than you would earn if you put the money into a savings account. For example, you can invest your money in a CD that pays 4 percent interest. You would not be allowed to withdraw your money for, say, two years without paying a penalty. Therefore, before buying the CD, you would want to weigh the greater return on your investment against the loss of liquidity. >> Analyze Political Cartoons How does this investment advisor misinterpret the term liquidity? >> Certificates of Deposit provide a greater rate of return than savings accounts. The trade-off is that CDs are not liquid, so investors cannot access their money until the CD matures. 6.5 Investing 267 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="334"> <text><![CDATA[ Risk and Return Certificates of deposit (up to $250,000) are considered very safe investments because they are insured by the federal government. When you buy a CD valued at less than $250,000, you are giving up liquidity for a certain period of time, but you are not risking the loss of your money. What if, however, you decided to invest the money in a new company that your friends are starting? You must consider the risk you are now incurring. If the company succeeds, you could double your investment. However, it may take years before it is clear that the company is successful. If it fails, however, you could lose all or part of the money you invested. The government does not insure you against the risk of an investment gone bad. You may benefit from the rewards of a good investment, but you face the risks of a bad one. To take another example, suppose your savings account is earning 2 percent interest. Would you be willing to lend money to your friend Emily for that same 2 percent interest rate, knowing that she rarely pays back loans on time? Probably not. For you to lend Emily the money, she would have to offer you a higher return than the bank could offer. This higher return would help offset the greater risk that Emily will not repay the loan on time&ndash;or that she does not repay the loan at all. Likewise, a large investor, such as a big company, might be willing to pay a higher rate of return on a riskier investment. In this way, the higher return encourages savers to put their money in parts of the economy that might be very productive but are also riskier. Whenever individuals evaluate an investment, they must balance the risks involved with the rewards they expect to gain from the investment. In general, the higher the potential return on an investment, the riskier the investment. Balancing this risk may be exceedingly tricky. Yet it&apos;s important to remember that investors will put their savings into an array of higher-and lower- risk investments while always trying to make the investments solid. By investing in this range, their savings are allocated to their most productive use. As Forbesmagazine has commented: The risk/return tradeoff could easily be called the ‘ability-to-sleep-at-night test.&apos; While some people can handle the equivalent of financial skydiving without batting an eye, others are terrified to climb the financial ladder without a secure harness.

Like the war bonds that helped finance our effort in World War II, bonds are sold by governments or corporations to finance projects. Using the example of a community that needs to construct a major road, you will see how municipal bonds offer the best method of financing expensive community projects. You will also learn another advantage of bonds. They are a type of investment that usually provides a higher return, but a greater risk, than a savings account. Bonds are basically loans, or IOUs, that represent debt that the seller, or issuer, must repay to an investor. Bonds typically pay the investor a fixed amount of interest at regular intervals for a specific amount of time. Bonds are generally lower-risk VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="337"> <text><![CDATA[ investments. As you might expect from your reading about the relationship between risk and return, the rate of return on bonds is usually also lower than for many other investments. The Three Components of Bonds Bonds have three basic components: Coupon rate The coupon rate is the interest rate that a bond issuer will pay to a bondholder. Maturity The time at which payment to a bondholder is due is called the bond&apos;s maturity. The length of time to maturity varies with different bonds. Bonds usually mature in 10, 20, or 30 years. Par value A bond&apos;s par value, assigned by the issuer, is the amount to be paid to the bondholder at maturity. Par value is also called face value or principal. Suppose that you buy a $1,000 bond from the corporation Jeans, Etc. The investor who buys the bond is called the holder. The seller of a bond is the issuer. You are, therefore, the holder of the bond, and Jeans, Etc. is the issuer. The components of this bond are as follows: Coupon rate:5 percent, paid to the bondholder annually Maturity: 10 years Par value: $1,000 How much money will you earn from this bond, and over what period of time? The coupon rate is 5 percent of $1,000 per year. This means that you will receive a payment of $50 (0.05 x $1,000) each year for 10 years, or a total of $500 in interest. In 10 years, the bond will have reached maturity, and the company&apos;s debt to you will have ended. Jeans, Etc. will now pay you the par value of the bond, or $1,000. Thus, for your $1,000 investment, you will have received $1,500 over a period of 10 years. Not all bonds are held to maturity. Over their lifetime they might be bought or sold, and their price may change. Because of these shifts in price, buyers and sellers are interested in a bond&apos;s yield, or yield to maturity. Yield is the annual rate of return on a bond if the bond is held to maturity (5 percent in the earlier example involving Jeans, Etc.). Buying Bonds at a Discount In the free enterprise system, investors earn money from interest on the bonds they buy. They can also earn money by buying bonds at a discount, called a discount from par. In other words, if Nate were buying a bond with a par value of $1,000, he may have to pay only $960 for it. When the bond matures, Nate will redeem the bond at par, or $1,000. He will thus have earned $40 on his investment, in addition to interest payments from the bond issuer. Why would someone sell a bond for less than its par value? The answer lies in the fact that interest rates continually change. For example, suppose that Sharon buys a $1,000 bond at 5 percent interest, the current market rate. A year later, she needs to sell the bond to help pay for a new car. By that time, however, interest rates have risen to 6 percent. No one will pay $1,000 for Sharon&apos;s bond at 5 percent interest when they could go elsewhere and buy a $1,000 bond at 6 percent interest. For Sharon to sell her bond at 5 percent, she will have to sell it at a discount. (See Figure 6.8.) Bond Ratings How does an investor decide which bonds to buy? Investors can check bond quality through independent firms that publish bond issuers&apos; credit ratings. These firms include Standard & Poor&apos;s and Moody&apos;s. They rate bonds on a number of factors, focusing on the issuer&apos;s financial strength&ndash;its ability to make future interest payments and its ability to repay the principal when the bond matures. >> Historically, bond owners cut out coupons that were printed on bonds (shown here) and redeemed the coupons for interest payments. Today, the interest rate is still called the coupon rate. 6.6 Bonds and Other Financial Assets 271 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="338"> <text><![CDATA[ Their rating systems rank bonds from the highest investment grade (AAA in Standard & Poor&apos;s system and AAA in Moody&apos;s) through the lower grades. An investment-grade bond is considered safe enough for banks to invest in. The lowest grade generally means that the bond is in default&ndash;that is, the issuer has not kept up with interest payments or has defaulted on paying principal. The higher the bond rating, the lower the interest rate the company usually has to pay to get people to buy its bonds. For example, an AAA (or “triple A”) bond may be issued at a 5 percent interest rate. A BBB bond, however, may be issued at a 7.5 percent interest rate. The buyer of the AAA bond trades off a lower interest rate for lower risk. The buyer of the BBB bond trades greater risk for a higher interest rate. Similarly, the higher the bond rating, the higher the price at which the bond will sell. For example, a $1,000 bond with an AAA rating may sell at $1,100. A $1,000 bond with a BBB rating may sell for only $950 because of the increased risk that the seller could default. Holders of bonds with high ratings who keep their bonds until maturity face relatively little risk of losing their investment. Holders of bonds with lower ratings, however, take on more risk in return for potentially higher interest payments. Costs and Benefits of Issuing Bonds From the point of view of the investor, bonds are good investments because they are relatively safe. Bonds are desirable from the issuer&apos;s point of view as well, for two main reasons: 1. Once the bond is sold, the coupon rate for that bond will not go up or down. For example, when Jeans, Etc. sells bonds, it knows in advance that it will be making fixed payments for a specific length of time. 2. Unlike stockholders, bondholders do not own a part of the company. Therefore, the company does not have to share profits with its bondholders if the company does particularly well. On the other hand, bonds also pose two main disadvantages to the issuer: 1. The company must make fixed interest payments, even in bad years when it does not make money. In addition, it cannot change its interest payments even when interest rates have gone down. 2. If the firm does not maintain financial health, its bonds may be downgraded to a lower bond rating and, thus, may be harder to sell unless they are offered at a discount.

Analyze Charts Which of these three types of government securities is the most liquid? Bounce to Activate Chart Types of Bonds Despite risks to the issuer, when corporations or governments need to borrow funds for long periods, they often issue bonds. There are several different types of bonds. Savings Bonds You may already be familiar with savings bonds, which are sometimes given to young people as gifts. Savings bonds are low- denomination ($50 to $10,000) bonds issued by the United States government. The government uses funds from the sale of savings bonds to help pay for public works projects such as buildings, roads, and dams. Like other government bonds, savings bonds have virtually no risk of default, or failure to repay the loan. The federal government pays interest on savings bonds. In the past, the rate of interest on savings bonds changed every six months. Since 2005, bonds earn a fixed rate of interest for 30 years, which means that investors can know far in advance what their investment will earn. Treasury Bonds, Bills, and Notes The United States Treasury Department issues Treasury bonds, as well as Treasury bills and notes (T-bills and T-notes). These investments offer different lengths of maturity, as shown in Figure 6.9. Backed by the “full faith and credit” of the United States government, these securities are among the safest investments in terms of default risk. One possible problem with bonds (and investments in general) is inflation. The purchase price and return on Treasury securities are governed by changing interest rates and market conditions. As a result, the value of Treasury securities as an investment must be carefully understood. If a Treasury bond pays you 5 percent interest per year, but the inflation rate is 3 percent, you are really getting just 2 percent interest on the bond. One type of bond issued mainly by the government seeks to protect against inflation&ndash;a general rise in prices. The inflation-indexed bond links the principal and interest to an inflation index&ndash;a measure of how fast prices are rising. If the index rises by 3 percent, this bond&apos;s par value will also rise by 3 percent. As a result, you will receive the return on the bond that you expected when you bought it. Municipal Bonds State and local governments and municipalities (government units with corporate status) issue bonds to finance such projects as highways, state buildings, libraries, parks, and schools. These bonds are called municipal bonds, or “munis.” Because state and local governments have the power to tax, investors can assume that these governments will be able to keep up with interest payments and repay the principal at maturity. Standard & Poor&apos;s and Moody&apos;s therefore consider most municipal bonds to be safe investments. In addition, the interest paid on municipal bonds is not 6.6 Bonds and Other Financial Assets 273 ]]></text>

Because they are relatively safe and are tax- exempt, “munis” are very attractive to investors as a long-term investment. A high-quality municipal bond can pay a good return for quite a long time. Corporate Bonds As you have already read, corporations issue bonds to help raise money to expand their businesses. These corporate bonds are generally issued in denominations of $1,000 or $5,000. The interest on corporate bonds is taxed as ordinary income. Unlike governments, corporations have no tax base to help guarantee their ability to repay their loans. Thus, these bonds have moderate levels of risk. Investors in corporate bonds must depend on the success of the corporation&apos;s sales of goods and services to generate enough income to pay interest and principal. In the free enterprise system, a corporation often needs to improve and expand its capital resources in order to grow. Using profits is one way to accomplish this, but sometimes a corporation needs more money than their profits can provide. If, for example, it wants to hire more workers, build new offices, or update its equipment, raising money through a bond issue is an option. By making improvements such as these, the corporation can Average Bond Yields, 2000–2012 grow its business substantially and earn more money than it borrows from the bondholders. Corporations that issue bonds are watched closely not only by the independent ratings firms, but also by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is an independent government agency that regulates financial markets and investment companies. It enforces laws prohibiting fraud and other dishonest investment practices. Each bond is issued with an indenture agreement. It sets forth all the features associated with the bond. The interest rate is specified on the indenture agreement. Junk Bonds Bonds with a fairly high risk of default but a potentially high yield are known as junk bonds. These non-investment-grade securities became especially popular investments during the 1980s and 1990s, when large numbers of aggressive investors made&ndash;but also sometimes lost&ndash;large sums of money buying and selling them. Junk bonds have been known to pay more than 12 percent interest at a time when government bonds were yielding only about 8 percent. On the other hand, the speculative nature of most junk bonds makes them very risky. Investors in junk bonds face a strong possibility that some of the issuing firms will default on their debt.

CHECK UNDERSTANDINg Which type of bond might have been used to fund the construction of your school? Other Types of Financial Assets In addition to bonds, investors may choose other financial assets. These include certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds, as well as stock. You will read more about stock later in this Topic. Certificates of Deposit Certificates of deposit (CDs) are one of the most common forms of investment. As you have read, CDs are available through banks, which lend out the funds deposited in CDs for a fixed amount of time, such as six months or two years. CDs are attractive to small investors because they can deposit as little as $100. Investors can also choose among several terms of maturity. This means that if an investor foresees a future expenditure, he or she can buy a CD that matures just before the expenditure is due. Money Market Mutual Funds Money market mutual funds are special types of mutual funds. Financial intermediaries collect money from individual investors and then buy stocks, bonds, or other financial assets to form a mutual fund. In the case of money market mutual funds, intermediaries buy short-term financial assets. Investors receive higher interest on a money market mutual fund than they would receive from a savings account. On the other hand, money market mutual funds are not covered by FDIC insurance. (As you read earlier in this Topic, FDIC insurance protects bank deposits up to $250,000 per account.) This lack of insurance makes them slightly riskier than savings accounts.

    <page pageNumber="342"> <text><![CDATA[ Financial Asset Markets Financial assets, including bonds, certificates of deposit, and money market mutual funds, are traded on financial asset markets. The various types of financial asset markets are classified in different ways. Capital Markets and Money Markets One way to classify financial asset markets is according to the length of time for which funds are lent. This type of classification includes both capital markets and money markets. Capital markets Markets in which money is lent for periods longer than a year are called capital markets. Financial assets that are traded in capital markets include long-term CDs and corporate and government bonds that require more than a year to mature. Money markets Markets in which money is lent for periods of one year or less are called money markets. Financial assets that are traded in money markets include short-term CDs, Treasury bills, and money market mutual funds. Primary and Secondary Markets Markets may also be classified according to whether assets can be resold to other buyers. This type of classification includes primary and secondary markets. Primary markets Financial assets that can be redeemed only by the original holder are sold on primary markets. Examples include savings bonds, which cannot be sold by the original buyer to another buyer. Small certificates of deposit are also in the primary market because investors would most likely cash them in early rather than trying to sell them to someone else. Secondary markets Financial assets that can be resold are sold on secondary markets. This option for resale provides liquidity to investors. If there is a strong secondary market for an asset, the investor knows that the asset can be resold fairly quickly without a penalty, thus providing the investor with ready cash. The secondary market also makes possible the lively trade in stock that is the subject of the next Lesson. CLASSIfy What are two ways of classifying financial asset markets? ASSESSMENT 1.

Newspapers often include a business section that lists the price of various stocks. Television news broadcasts highlight the latest price changes. You may even see stock prices crawling across the bottom of your TV screen. But just what is stock, exactly how is it traded, and when is it a good investment? You have read about how corporations, when they need money to expand their business, will often borrow it by selling bonds. A bond carries with it a promise to investors to repay the borrowed money, with interest. Corporations can also raise funds by issuing stock, which is a certificate of ownership in a corporation. Unlike someone who buys a bond, an investor who buys stock in a corporation becomes a part-owner of that corporation. Stock is issued in portions known as shares. By selling shares of stock, corporations raise money to start, run, and expand their businesses.

    <page pageNumber="344"> <text><![CDATA[ stockholders. Dividends are usually paid four times per year (quarterly). The size of the dividend depends on the corporation&apos;s profit. The higher the profit, the larger the dividend per share of stock. Capital gains A second way an investor can earn a profit is to sell the stock for more than he or she paid for it. The difference between the higher selling price and the lower purchase price is called a capital gain. An investor who sells a stock at a price lower than the purchase price, however, suffers a capital loss. Types of Stock Stock may be classified in several ways, such as whether or not it pays dividends. Income stock By paying dividends, this stock provides investors with regular income. Growth stock This stock pays few or no dividends. Instead, the issuing company reinvests its earnings in its business. The business (and its stock) thus grows in value over time. Stock may also be classified as to whether or not the stockholders have a vote in company policy. Common stock Investors who buy common stock are usually voting owners of the company. They usually receive one vote for each share of stock owned. They may use this vote, for example, to help elect the company&apos;s board of directors. In some cases, a relatively small group of people may own enough shares to give them control over the company. Preferred stock Investors who buy preferred stock are usually nonvoting owners of the company. Owners of preferred stock, however, receive dividends before the owners of common stock. If the company goes out of business, preferred stockholders get their investments back before common stockholders. Stock Splits Owners of common stock may sometimes vote on whether to initiate a stock split. A stock split means that each single share of stock splits into more than one share. A company may seek to split a stock when the price of stock becomes so high that it discourages potential investors from buying it. For example, suppose you own 200 shares in a sporting goods company called Ultimate Sports. Each share is worth $100. After a 2-for-1 split, you own 400 shares of Ultimate Sports, or two shares of stock for every single share you owned before. Because the price is divided along with the stock, however, each share is now worth only $50. Thus a stock split does not immediately result in any financial gain. Shareholders like splits, however, because splits usually demonstrate that the company is doing well, and the lower stock price tends to attract more investors. 50 SHARES$3,000 $60 EACH@ = 100 SHARES$3,000 $30 EACH@ = HOW A STOCK SPLIT WORKS STOCKSPLIT >> A stock split doubles the amount of shares that a stockholder owns.

Analyze Charts Which type of stock shown here is the safest? Risks of Investing in Stock Purchasing stock is risky, because the firm selling the stock may earn lower profits than expected, or it may lose money. If so, the dividends will be smaller than expected or nothing at all, and the market price of the stock will probably decrease. If the price of the stock decreases, investors who choose to sell their stock will get less than they paid for it, experiencing a capital loss. How do the risk and rate of return on stocks compare with the risk and rate of return on bonds? As you have read, investors expect higher rates of return when they take on greater risk. Because of the laws governing bankruptcy, stocks are more risky than bonds. When a firm goes bankrupt, it sells its assets (such as land and equipment) and then pays its creditors, including bondholders, first. Stockholders receive a share of the assets only if there is money left over after bondholders are paid. As you might expect, because stocks are riskier than bonds, the return on stocks is generally higher. RECALL What are two ways to make a profit from investing in a stock? Stock Trading Suppose you decide that you want to buy stock. How do you get started? Do you call up the company and place an order? Probably not, because very few companies sell stock directly. Instead, you would contact a stockbroker, a person who links buyers and sellers of stock. Stockbrokers usually work with individual investors, advising them to buy or sell particular stocks. Stockbrokers work for brokerage firms, or businesses that specialize in trading stocks. Stockbrokers and brokerage firms cover their costs and earn a profit by charging a commission, or fee, on each stock transaction. Sometimes, they also act as dealers of stock, meaning that they buy shares at a lower price and sell them to investors at a slightly higher price, profiting from the difference, or “spread.” Stock Exchanges A market for buying and selling stock is known as a stock exchange. Stock exchanges act as secondary markets for stocks and bonds. That is, stocks and bonds are not sold directly by corporations through the stock exchange but are resold by investors. Most newspapers and many Web sites publish data on transactions in major stock exchanges. (See Figure 6.10 to learn how to 6.7 Stocks 279 ]]></text>

In addition, a large number of people trade stocks on the Internet, using online brokerage firms or special trading software. The ease of this approach also makes it very risky, because snap judgments can often be wrong&ndash;and very costly. New York Stock Exchange The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is probably the country&apos;s best known exchange. The NYSE began in 1792 as an informal, outdoor exchange in New York&apos;s financial district. Over time, as the financial market developed and the demand to buy and sell financial assets grew, the exchange moved indoors and became restricted to a limited number of members who bought “seats” allowing them to trade on the exchange. In 2013, the NYSE was purchased by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) an Atlanta-based company that runs commodities and other types of exchanges around the world. The NYSE handles stock and bond transactions for the top companies in the United States and in the world. The largest, most financially sound, and best-known firms listed on the NYSE are referred to as blue chip companies. Blue chip stocks are often in high demand, because investors expect the companies to continue to do business profitably for a long time. Nasdaq Despite the importance of organized markets like the New York Stock Exchange, many stocks, as well as bonds, are not traded on the floor of stock exchanges. Instead, they are traded directly, on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Using a telephone or the Internet, investors may buy directly from a dealer or broker who will search other dealers or brokers on the OTC market for the best price. The Nasdaq (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation) system was created in 1971 to help organize the OTC market through the use of automation. It grew rapidly in the 1990s, in part by focusing on new-technology stocks. Today, the Nasdaq Stock Market (as it became known) is the second-largest securities market in the country and the largest electronic market for stocks. It handles more trades on average than any other American market. True to its OTC roots, Nasdaq has no physical trading floor. Instead it has a telecommunications network through which it broadcasts trading information to computer terminals throughout the world. Futures and Options Futures are contracts to buy or sell commodities at a particular date in the future at a price specified today. For example, a buyer and seller might agree today on a price of $4.50 per bushel for soybeans that would not reach the market until six or nine months from now. The buyer would pay some portion of the money today, and the seller would deliver the goods in the future.

These markets include the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. Similarly, options are contracts that give investors the choice to buy or sell stock and other financial assets. Investors may buy or sell a particular stock at a particular price up until a certain time in the future&ndash;usually three to six months. The option to buy shares of stock until a specified time in the future is known as a call option. For example, you may pay $10 per share today for a call option. The call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a certain stock at a price of, say, $100 per share. If at the end of six months, the price has gone up to $115 per share, your option still allows you to purchase the stock for the agreed- upon $100 per share. You thus earn $5 per share ($15 minus the $10 you paid for the call option). If, on the other hand, the price has dropped to $80, you can throw away the option and buy the stock at the going rate. The option to sell shares of stock at a specified time in the future is called a put option. Suppose that you, as the seller, pay $5 per share for the right to sell a particular stock that you do not yet own at $50 per share. If the price per share falls to $40, you can buy the share at that price and require the contracted buyer to pay the agreed-upon $50. You would then make $5 per share on the sale ($10 minus the $5 you paid for the put option). If the price rises to $60, however, you can throw away the option and sell the stock for $60. Day Trading Most people who buy stock hold their investment for a significant period of time&ndash; sometimes many years&ndash;with the expectation that it will grow in value. Day traders use a different strategy. They might make dozens of trades per day, sometimes holding a stock for just minutes or even seconds. The typical day trader, sitting in front of a computer, hopes to ride a rising stock&apos;s momentum for a short time and then sell the stock for a quick profit. Day trading is a bit like gambling&ndash;it is a very risky business in which traders can lose a great deal of money.

What do these terms mean, and how can an investor track increases and decreases in the sale of stocks? Bull and Bear Markets When stock prices in general steadily rise for a period of time, a bull market exists. On the other hand, when stock prices steadily fall or stagnate for a period of time, analysts call it a bear market. In a bull market, >> Large gains on the stock market are often followed by large losses. Analyze Political Cartoons What object in this cartoon symbolizes the stock market? Why did the cartoonist choose it? investors expect an increase in profits and, therefore, buy stock. During a bear market, investors sell stock in expectation of lower profits. The 1980s and 1990s brought the longest sustained bull market in the nation&apos;s history. Between 2000 and 2006, the market went through brief cycles of bear and bull markets. Then general concerns about the economy, and the subprime mortgage crisis, led to a bear market lasting from October 2007 to March 2009. During that time, the stock market lost some 54 percent of its value. After that, a strong bull market developed. Dow Jones Industrial Average When newscasters say “the stock market rose today,” they are often referring to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a measure of stock performance known simply as “the Dow.” The Dow is the average value of a particular set of stocks, and it is reported as a certain number of points. For example, on a good day, the Dow might rise 60 points. The group of stocks listed on the Dow is intended to represent the market as a whole. To make sure it does, some of the stocks are periodically dropped and others added. Today, those stocks represent 30 large, very strong, and influential companies in various industries, such as food, energy, and technology. S&P 500 The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor&apos;s 500) gives a broader picture of stock performance than the Dow. It tracks the price changes of 500 different stocks as a measure of overall stock market performance. The S&P 500 reports mainly on stocks listed on the NYSE, but some of its stocks are traded on the Nasdaq market. DEfINE What do investors tend to do during a bull market? The Great Crash and Beyond Like the 1980s and 1990s, the 1920s saw a long-term bull market. Unfortunately, this period ended in a horrifying collapse of the stock market known as the Great Crash of 1929. The causes of this collapse contain important lessons for investors in the twenty-first century. Investing During the 1920s When President Herbert Hoover took office in 1929, the United States economy seemed to be in excellent shape. 282 TOPIC 6 Money, Banking, and Financial Markets ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="349"> <text><![CDATA[ The booming economy had dramatically changed the lives of Americans. Factories produced a steady stream of consumer products, including washing machines, toasters, and automobiles. The stock market was soaring. In 1925, the market value of all stocks had been $27 billion. By early October 1929, combined stock values had hit $87 billion. Despite widespread optimism about continuing prosperity, there were signs of trouble. A relatively small number of companies and families held much of the nation&apos;s wealth, while many farmers and workers were suffering financially. In addition, many ordinary people went into debt buying consumer goods such as refrigerators and radios&ndash;new and exciting inventions at the time&ndash;on credit. Finally, industries were producing more goods than consumers could buy. As a result, some industries, including the important automobile industry, developed large surpluses of goods, and prices began to slump. Another economic danger sign was the debt that investors were piling up by playing the stock market. The dizzying climb of stock prices encouraged widespread speculation, the practice of making high-risk investments with borrowed money in hopes of getting a big return. Before World War I, only the wealthy had bought and sold shares in the stock market. Now, however, the press was reporting stories of ordinary people making fortunes in the stock market. Small investors thus began speculating in stocks, often with their life savings. One man described how he began speculating in the following way: One day, one of my customers showed me how much money he was making in the market.... I bit with what you folks call ‘hook, line and sinker.&apos; All the money I took in, I put into stocks. The first day of October in 1929 made me feel like I was rich. The stocks I bought had gone up and up.? &ndash;American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers&apos; Project, 1936–1940 To attract less-wealthy investors, stockbrokers encouraged a practice called buying on margin. Buying on margin allowed investors to purchase a stock for only a fraction of its price and borrow the rest from the brokerage firm. The Hoover administration did little to discourage such risky loans. >> In the 1920s, consumers went into debt to buy the latest innovations, including radios like the one advertised here. The Crash By September 3, 1929, the Dow had reached an all-time high of 381 points. The rising stock prices dominated the news. Prices for many stocks soared far above their real values in terms of the company&apos;s earnings and assets. After their peak in September, stock prices began to fall. Some brokers demanded repayment of loans. When the stock market closed on Wednesday, October 23, 1929, the Dow had dropped 21 points in an hour. The next day, worried investors began to sell, and stock prices fell further. Although business and political leaders told the public not to worry about their losses, widespread panic began. By Monday, October 28, 1929, shares of stock were dropping in value to a fraction of what people had paid for them. Investors all over the country were racing to get what was left of their money out of the stock market. On October 29, 1929, forever known as Black Tuesday, a record 16.4 million shares were sold, compared with the average 4 to 8 million shares per day earlier in the year. The Great Crash had begun. In the Wake of the Crash During the bull market that led up to the Crash, about 4 million people had invested in the stock market.

Massive unemployment became the most obvious sign of the deepening depression. By 1933, more than one quarter of the labor force was out of work. Many Americans lost their homes as well as their jobs during the Great Depression. Desperate for shelter, they erected shacks of scrap wood, old tin, and other materials that they could scavenge. As more and more shacks sprang up, they formed shabby little villages. The residents, who blamed their troubles on the policies of President Hoover, called these shantytowns “Hoovervilles.” Mistakes in monetary policy slowed the nation&apos;s recovery. In 1929, the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) had begun limiting the money supply in order to discourage speculation. It continued this policy, even as the economy worsened. With too little money in circulation, individuals and businesses could not spend enough to help the economy improve. Shifting Attitudes Toward Owning Stocks After the Depression, many people saw stocks as risky investments to be avoided. As late as 1980, a relatively small percentage of American households held stock. Gradually, however, attitudes began to change. For one thing, the development of mutual History of the Dow funds made it easy to own a wide range of stocks. Americans became more comfortable with stock ownership. After a period of very strong growth, stocks crashed again on “Black Monday,” October 18, 1987. The Dow lost 22.6 percent of its value that day&ndash; nearly twice the one-day loss that began the Great Crash of 1929. However, this time the market rebounded on each of the next two days, and the impact on the economy was much less severe. The Fed moved quickly to add liquidity and reduce interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The shock of the 1987 crash wore off quickly. Within two years, the Dow had returned to pre-crash levels. Starting in 1990, stock prices began to soar on the strength of a growing economy and a technology boom. Many people bought stock for the first time, investing heavily in internet-based companies and other new, high-tech enterprises. A so-called dot. com boom raised stock prices of Internet-based securities to wildly unrealistic levels. At the end of the 1990s, almost half of American households owned mutual funds.

In 2001, an economic downturn and the September 11 terrorist attacks further battered the stock market. That same year, the stock market took yet another hit. An enormous energy-trading company named Enron filed for bankruptcy in December after revealing that it had falsely reported profits for several years in order to cover up huge losses. The price of its once high-flying stock fell from $90 per share to less than $1. Soon, several other large firms faced similar financial scandals. In 2002, Congress responded to the scandals with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This legislation was aimed at reforming lax accounting practices. As a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, top corporate leaders now have to verify that financial reports are accurate or face criminal charges. A Market in Turmoil In time, the stock market recovered and reached new heights, boosted by a red-hot real estate market. In October 2006, the Dow passed the 11,700-point mark. It reached 14,000 in 2007. Then, as investors realized the full extent of the subprime mortgage crisis, the stock market again nosedived. By the end of 2008, it had plunged back to the 8,000 range. Trillions of dollars worth of investments were lost, and people saw their retirement savings lose much of their value. Safe investments, such as corporate and municipal bonds, also were badly hit. The financial crisis even caused the collapse of the renowned investment firm Lehman Brothers. Although the stock market slowly recovered, the market turmoil left investors uneasy.

Lesson 1: The Role of Money LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.13 Money is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Money is durable, portable, divisible, and uniform. The supply of money must be limited, and it must be acceptable as payment. Commodity money has the value of the commodity it contains. Representative money has the value of an object for which it can be exchanged. Fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, has value because the government declares it valuable. Lesson 2: Changes in American Banking SS.912.E.2.3, SS.912.E.2.10 The United States once alternated between centralized banking and decentralized banking, which brought instability. After a 1907 bank run&ndash;when many people tried to withdraw money and banks failed&ndash;the U.S. government set up the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) to regulate banks and the money supply. The Great Depression brought more regulation. Since deregulation in the 1970s and 1980s, the country has faced financial crises. Lesson 3: The Federal Reserve System LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.2.10 Over time, the Fed has gained independence and power. It is controlled by a Board of Governors led by a chairperson, all appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. It serves as a banker and issuer of currency for the government, and regulates the nation&apos;s banks and money supply. Lesson 4: The Functions of Modern Banks SS.912.E.1.13, SS.912.E.1.16 The money supply consists of currency and money in bank accounts and deposits. Different kinds of financial services, including banks, provide a variety of services such as letting people save or borrow money. To take advantage of financial services, consumers need to budget to make sure that their expenses do not exceed their income. Lesson 5: Investing SS.912.E.1.14, SS.912.E.1.15 Investment is putting aside resources to create benefits in the future rather than consuming them today. The financial system&ndash;made up of financial intermediaries such as banks and mutual funds&ndash;transfers money between savers or investors and borrowers or investments. Potential returns on investments depend on liquidity, which tends to limit returns, and on risk, which may increase returns at the cost of possible loss. Lesson 6: Bonds and Other Financial Assets SS.912.E.1.15 Bonds are loans with an interest rate&ndash;or yield&ndash;that borrowers must repay, along with the original loan, at the end of a fixed term. Governments and corporations issue bonds. Besides bonds, investors may put money into certificates of deposit with banks, or money market mutual funds. Investments are traded on markets. Lesson 7: Stocks SS.912.E.1.15 Stock is a share of ownership of a corporation. People invest in stock hoping for a gain in value or for dividends&ndash;meaning a share of profits. They face the risk that it will fall in value and they will lose money. Stock is traded on exchanges. Stocks have risen and fallen in value over time, with sharp drops during financial crises. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="355"> <text><![CDATA[ DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTIONS LAFS.1112.RH.3.7 In the early 2000s, investor confidence in the stock market was shaken by a series of scandals. To restore the faith of investors, Congress passed a series of laws to regulate corporate accounting practices. Today, many people continue to support increased government regulation of financial markets. Others believe that government regulation has been harmful to financial markets and the economy in general. DOCUMENT A A Democratic Senator gave a speech in 2015 calling for stronger financial regulations. [W]ithout some basic rules and accountability, financial markets don&apos;t work. People get ripped off, risk-taking explodes, and the markets blow up. That&apos;s just an empirical fact – clearly observable in 1929 and again in 2008. The point is worth repeating because, for too long, the opponents of financial reform have cast this debate as an argument between the pro-regulation camp and the pro-market camp, generally putting Democrats in the first camp and Republicans in the second. But that so-called choice gets it wrong. Rules are not the enemy of markets. Rules are a necessary ingredient for healthy markets, for markets that create competition and innovation. And rolling back the rules or firing the cops can be profoundly anti-market. &ndash;Senator Elizabeth Warren, “The Unfinished Business of Financial Reform” DOCUMENT B A Republican member of the United States Congress expresses a different viewpoint on increased regulation of financial markets. The long-term impact of increasing strict rules and regulations can be just as damaging as fraud and manipulation that occurs in an open system&ndash;probably more so. The increase of rules and regulation adds costs and administrative effort. In effect, companies face disincentives to engage in fair and honest activity. Thus, overregulation is also a destructive activity. &ndash;U.S. Representative Jeff Flake, Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition DOCUMENT C This cartoon expresses one point of view about government regulation of financial markets. 22. The author of which document would be most likely to agree with the following statement: “In order to limit harm to others, stricter regulation is needed”? A. Document A only B. Document B only C. Documents A and C D. Documents B and C 23. Document C supports the idea that regulation of financial markets A. is a necessary evil. B. places too heavy burden on businesses. C. requires up-to-date technology in order to work. D. is the responsibility of the federal government. 24. The authors of Documents A and B disagree about whether A. stricter financial regulation is needed. B. executives should be punished for fraud. C. regulation has much impact. D. competitive markets are key to the economy. 25. Writing Task Evaluate the three perspectives on government regulation presented here.

Economists have developed many tools to monitor the nation&apos;s economic performance. They even have a way to measure how much money families like yours have to spend. You will learn what these measures tell us&ndash;and don&apos;t tell us&ndash;about the economy. Economists use a system called national income accounting to monitor the U.S. economy. They collect and organize macroeconomic statistics on production, income, investment, and savings. The Department of Commerce then presents these data in the form of National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). The government uses NIPA data to determine economic policies. What is GDP? The most important measure in NIPA is gross domestic product (GDP), which is the dollar value of all final goods and services produced within a country&apos;s borders in a given VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="361"> <text><![CDATA[ year. To help you understand GDP, let us examine each part of this definition: Dollar value refers to the total cash value of the sales of all goods and services produced in a country&apos;s households, firms, and government in a calendar year. Since different quantities of goods such as oranges, computers, and movie tickets are sold at different prices, economists figure out the average prices of these items and the total number sold during the year. These cash figures are then used to calculate GDP. Final goods and services are products in the form sold to consumers. They differ from intermediate goods, which are products used in the production of final goods. The memory chips that a computer maker buys to put into its machines are intermediate goods; the computer is a final good. Produced within a country&apos;s borders is especially important to remember. Because we are trying to find the country&apos;s gross domesticproduct, we can look only at the goods and services produced within that country. For example, the GDP of the U.S. economy includes cars made in Ohio by a Japanese car company but not cars made in Brazil by an American automaker. In a given year takes into account when a good was produced. Suppose your neighbor sells you his used car. When the car was originally made, it was counted in the GDP of that year. Thus, it would be inaccurate to count it toward GDP again this year when it was resold. The Expenditure Approach Government economists calculate GDP two ways. In one method, they use the expenditure approach, sometimes called the output-expenditure approach. First, economists estimate the annual expenditures, or amounts spent, on four categories of final goods and services: 1. consumer goods and services 2. business goods and services 3. government goods and services 4. net exports Two of these categories need explanation. First, bear in mind that consumer goods include two kinds of goods. They are durable goods&ndash;those that last for a relatively long time, such as refrigerators and DVD players&ndash;and nondurable goods&ndash;those that last a short period of time, such as food, light bulbs, and sneakers. Net exports are found by adding up exports&ndash; goods produced in the country but purchased in other countries&ndash;and then subtracting imports. Imports, of course, were produced in another country. After finding the value of those four categories, economists add them together to arrive at the total Suppose an economy&apos;s entire output is cars and trucks. 1 This year the economy produces: 2 $150,000 $200,000 $350,000 = = = + Total CONCLUSION The economy&apos;s GDP for this year is $350,000. 10 CARS PURCHASED AT $15,000 EACH 10 TRUCKS PURCHASED AT $20,000 EACH $EXPENDITURE APPROACH $ >> Figure 7.1 Analyze Charts How would the country&apos;s GDP change if the economy produced trucks that were purchased for $25,000 each instead of $20,000 each? 7.1 Gross Domestic Product 295 Bounce to Activate Chart ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="362"> <text><![CDATA[ expenditures on goods and services produced during the year. This total equals GDP. Figure 7.1 provides a simplified example of calculating GDP with the expenditure approach. The Income Approach The second method to calculate GDP, known as the income approach, is shown in Figure 7.2. This method calculates GDP by adding up all the incomes in the economy. The rationale for this approach is that when a firm sells a product or service, the selling price minus the dollar value of goods and services purchased from other firms represents income for the firm&apos;s owners and employees. Suppose your neighbor bought a newly built house for $200,000. That $200,000 (minus what the builder spent on lumber, plaster, etc.) is income shared by all of the people who helped build and sell the house&ndash;including the contractor, the bricklayer, the roofers, and the real estate broker. Each of these people may get only a small share of the house&apos;s selling price. However, if we added up all those shares, we would arrive at $200,000 (minus what the builder spent on lumber, plaster, etc.) worth of income generated by the sale. This same logic holds for all goods and services. Thus, we may calculate GDP by adding up all income earned in the economy. In theory, calculating GDP with the income approach and the expenditure approach should give us the same total. In fact, there are usually differences because of errors in the underlying data. Economists who work in the federal government take those differences into account. They first determine GDP using both approaches. Then they compare the two totals and make adjustments to offset the differences. This gives them a more accurate result. ExPLAIN Why are imports not included in gross domestic product? Two Measures of GDP Government officials use gross domestic product to find out how well the economy is performing. To help them understand what is really going on in the economy, economists distinguish between two measures of GDP, nominal and real. Calculating Nominal GDP In Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2, we calculated nominal GDP&ndash;that is, GDP measured in current prices. Because it is based 1 Suppose an economy&apos;s entire output is cars and trucks. All employed citizens would work in the car and truck industry or its suppliers. The combined selling price of all the cars and trucks would reflect the money paid to all the people who helped build the vehicles. The economy&apos;s GDP for this year would be the sum of the income of all working citizens, or $350,000. 2 3 4 Engineers Designers Planners Assembly-line workers Managers Suppliers (metal, glass, etc.) +++++ COMBINED INCOME = $350,000 INCOME APPROACH >> Figure 7.2 The income approach, which adds up all the incomes in the economy, is generally more accurate than the expenditure approach.

Nominal GDP for Year 2 is $444,000, but this sum includes price increases. Economists prefer a measure of GDP that is not affected by price changes. Economists establish constant prices by choosing one year as a base year. To correct for an increase in prices, we calculate real GDP for Year 2 using Year 1 prices: Real GDP for Year 2, therefore, is $420,000, showing an increase of $70,000 in real dollars over the previous year.

This year the economy produces: Nominal GDP for Year 1 is $350,000. YEAR 1: NOMINAL GDP >> Figure 7.3 Although nominal GDP offers useful information, real GDP corrects for increases in prices. Analyze Charts What is the difference between nominal and real GDP for Year 2? on current prices, this type of GDP is also called “current GDP.” To calculate nominal GDP, we simply use the current year&apos;s prices to calculate the value of the current year&apos;s output. Figure 7.3 shows how the definition of nominal GDP applies to the small economy that produces only cars and trucks. Calculating Real GDP The data in Figure 7.3 reveal a problem with nominal GDP. The GDP of Year 2 is higher than that of Year 1 even though the output of cars and trucks in the two years is the same. The difference is due to an increase in prices. As a result of these price increases, the higher GDP figure in the second year is misleading. To correct for this distortion, economists determine real GDP, which is GDP expressed in constant, or unchanging, prices. Look at the third section of Figure 7.3. Notice that GDP in Year 2 is based on the prices from Year 1. By using real GDP, economists can discover whether an economy is actually producing more goods and services, regardless of changes in the prices of those items. In Figure 7.3, we can quickly see that output did not increase in Year 2. IdENTIfy What problem is solved by using real GDP? What GDP Doesn&apos;t Measure Even though GDP is a valuable tool, it is not a perfect yardstick. For instance, GDP does not take into account certain economic activities or aspects of life. These include nonmarket activities, the underground economy, negative externalities, and quality of life. Nonmarket Activities GDP does not measure goods and services that people make or do themselves, such as caring for children, mowing the lawn, cooking dinner, or washing the car. GDP does rise, however, when people pay someone else to do these things for them. When these nonmarket activities are shifted to the market, GDP goes up, even though production has not really increased. The Underground Economy A large amount of production and income is never recorded or reported to the government. For instance, transactions on the black market&ndash;the market for illegal goods&ndash;are not counted. Income from illegal gambling goes unreported. So do “under the table” wages that some companies pay workers to avoid paying business and income taxes. Many legal, informal transactions are also not reported, for example, selling your bike to a friend or 7.1 Gross Domestic Product 297 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="364"> <text><![CDATA[ trading that bike for a stereo. If you earned money baby-sitting, mowing lawns, or shoveling snow, those payments are not included in the GDP either, even though goods and services were produced and income was earned. Negative Externalities Unintended economic side effects, or externalities, have a monetary value that often is not reflected in GDP. For example, a power plant that emits smoke and dust is polluting the air. That negative result is not subtracted from GDP. Quality of Life Although some economists and politicians interpret rising GDP as a sign of rising well-being, we should remember that additional goods and services do not necessarily make people any happier. In fact, some things that are not counted in GDP contribute greatly to most people&apos;s quality of life, such as pleasant surroundings, ample leisure time, and personal safety. All of these limitations suggest that GDP is a somewhat flawed measure of output and income and doesn&apos;t fully measure the personal well-being of all. Nevertheless, while the measure may be imperfect, when calculated consistently over a period of time, GDP helps reveal economic growth rates. For this reason, economists and policymakers closely watch the nation&apos;s GDP. SyNThESIzE Cleaning your house is an example of what type of activity? Other Economic Measures As you have read, our system of National Income and Product Accounts provides numerous measurements of the performance of the nation&apos;s economy. While gross domestic product is the primary measure of income and output, economists also look at other measures to focus on specific parts of the economy. Many of these other yardsticks are derived from GDP. Figure 7.4 shows how GDP is used to determine five other economic measures. The first is gross national product (GNP), the annual income earned by a nation&apos;s firms and citizens. GNP is a measure of the market value of all goods and services produced by Americans in one year. Study the chart to see how GNP is related to GDP. GNP does not account for depreciation, or the loss of the value of capital equipment that results from normal wear and tear. The cost of replacing this physical capital slightly reduces the value of what we produce.

    <page pageNumber="365"> <text><![CDATA[ of capital equipment is called net national product (NNP). NNP measures the net output for one year, or the output made after the adjustment for depreciation. Once they have calculated NNP, government economists adjust their figures to account for minor discrepancies between different sources of data. After making these minor adjustments to NNP, they get another measure, called national income (NI). From NI, we can find out how much pretax income businesses actually pay to U.S. households. This is found by subtracting the profits that firms reinvest in the business and the income taxes and Social Security taxes they pay out. What remains is called personal income (PI). Finally, we want to know how much money people actually have to spend after they pay theirtaxes, a figure called disposable personal income (DPI). To find DPI, we take personal income and subtract individual income and Social Security taxes. See how far we have come? Beginning with GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in a year, we wind up knowing how much cash Americans have to spend or put in the bank. dESCRIbE What is disposable personal income? Factors That Affect GDP So far, we have defined GDP, calculated it, and learned about its limitations. One important issue remains, however: What influences GDP? That is, in a real economy, what factors can make GDP go up or down? These questions go to the heart of macroeconomics. Aggregate Supply As you read earlier, market supply is the amount of a particular good or service available for purchase at all possible prices in an individual market. But how do we look at supply and prices on a macroeconomic level? Think of aggregate supply as a supply curve for the whole economy. First, economists add up the total supply of goods and services produced for sale in the economy&ndash;in other words, GDP. Then they calculate the price level, the average of all prices in the economy. Now they can determine aggregate supply, the total amount of goods and services in the economy available at all possible price levels. In a nation&apos;s economy, as the prices of most goods and services change, the price level changes. Firms Aggregate Supply Price level AS Real GDP >> Figure 7.5 Analyze Graphs What does the positive slope of the graph mean? respond by changing their output. For example, if the price level rises, which means that the prices of most goods and services are rising, firms have an incentive to increase their output. Similarly, as prices throughout the economy fall, companies&apos; profits shrink. In response, they reduce output. You can see this effect in the aggregate supply (AS) curve in Figure 7.5. As the price level rises, real GDP, or aggregate supply, rises. As the price level falls, real GDP falls. Aggregate Demand Aggregate demand is the amount of goods and services in the economy that will be purchased at all possible price levels. As price levels in the economy move up and down, individuals and businesses change how much they buy&ndash;in the opposite direction that aggregate supply changes. For example, a lower price level translates into greater purchasing power for households, because the real value of money rises as price levels drop. The dollars that we hold are worth more at lower price levels than they are at higher price levels. Therefore, falling prices increase wealth and demand. This scenario is called the wealth effect. On the other hand, as the price level rises, purchasing power declines, causing a reduction in the quantity of goods and services demanded. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows this 7.1 Gross Domestic Product 299 ]]></text>

Aggregate Supply/Aggregate Demand Equilibrium When we put together the aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) curves, we can find the AS/AD equilibrium in the economy as a whole. Look at Figure 7.7. The intersection of the AS and AD curves indicates an equilibrium price level of P1 and an equilibrium real GDP of Q1. Now consider how GDP might change. Any shift in either the AS or AD curve will cause real GDP to change. For example, the graph shows aggregate demand falling from line AD1 to line AD2. As a result, the equilibrium GDP (Q2) falls, and so does the equilibrium price level (P2).

Describe four factors that keep business cycles going. Explain how economists predict changes in business cycles. Analyze the impact of business cycles in U.S. history. >> Key Terms business cycle expansion economic growth peak contraction trough recession depression stagflation business investment leading indicators Business Cycle Phases The national economy undergoes periodic cycles of good times, then bad times, and then good times again. Recognizing this pattern, economists try to predict what the economy will do in the future&ndash;what can be done to make the good times last longer and keep the bad times brief. You will learn what factors affect these ups and downs and how they have shaped the country&apos;s economy. You will also see how the actions of ordinary consumers and borrowers can affect the phases of the economy and how long these phases last. A business cycle is a period of macroeconomic expansion followed by a period of macroeconomic contraction. Economists also call these periods of change “economic fluctuations.” Business cycles are not minor, day-to-day ups and downs. They are major changes in real gross domestic product above or below normal levels. As you can see in Figure 7.8, the typical business cycle consists of four phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. Expansion An expansion is a period of economic growth as measured by a rise in real GDP. To economists, economic growth is a steady, long-term increase in real GDP. In the expansion phase, jobs are plentiful, the unemployment rate falls, and businesses prosper.

    <page pageNumber="368"> <text><![CDATA[ Peak When real GDP stops rising, the economy has reached its peak, the height of an economic expansion. Contraction After reaching its peak, the economy enters a period of contraction, an economic decline marked by falling real GDP. Falling output generally causes unemployment to rise. Trough When the economy has “bottomed out,” it has reached the trough (trawf), the lowest point in an economic contraction. At that point, real GDP stops falling and a new period of expansion begins. During a contraction, GDP is always falling. But other economic conditions, such as price levels and the unemployment rate, may vary. Economists have created terms to describe contractions with different characteristics and levels of severity. They include: Recession If real GDP falls for two consecutive quarters (at least six straight months), the economy is said to be in a recession. A recession is a prolonged economic contraction. Generally lasting from 6 to 18 months, recessions are typically marked by unemployment reaching the range of 6 percent to 10 percent. Depression If a recession is especially long and severe, it may be called a depression. The term has no precise definition but usually refers to a deep recession with features such as high unemployment and low economic output. Stagflation This term combines parts of stagnant&ndash;a word meaning “unmoving” or Tracking a Business Cycle “decayed”&ndash;and inflation. Stagflation is a decline in real GDP (output) combined with a rise in the price level (inflation). Although economists know much about business cycles, they cannot predict how long the phases in a particular cycle will last. The only certainty is that a growing economy will eventually experience a downturn, and that a contracting economy will eventually bounce back. INTERPRET If real GDP has fallen for three consecutive quarters, and the unemployment rate is nearing 10 percent, what period of economic fluctuation is the economy in? What Drives Business Cycles? The shifts that occur during a business cycle have many causes, some more predictable than others. Often, two or more factors will combine to push the economy into the next phase of a business cycle. Typically, a sharp rise or drop in some important economic variable will set off a series of events that bring about the next phase. Business cycles are affected by four main economic variables: 1. business investment 2. interest rates and credit 3. consumer expectations 4. external shocks ExpansionExpansionExpansion Peak Peak Peak ContractionContraction Tr ough Tr ough Increasing employment, income, and general prosperity Dwindling business activity; unemployment >> Figure 7.8 Analyze Information What is the point of slowest business activity in a business cycle called?

    <page pageNumber="369"> <text><![CDATA[ Why Businesses Make Investments When the economy is expanding, businesses might expect to increase the goods or services they produce. Therefore, they may invest heavily in building new plants and buying new equipment. Or they may invest in the expansion of old plants in order to increase the plants&apos; productive capacity. All of this business investment spending creates additional output and jobs, helping to increase GDP and maintain the expansion. At some point, however, firms may decide that they have expanded enough or that demand for their products is dropping. They cut back on investment spending; as a result, aggregate demand falls. The result is a decline in GDP and also in the price level. The drop in business spending reduces output and income in other sectors of the economy. When that occurs, industries that produce capital goods slow their own production and begin to lay off workers. Other industries might follow, causing overall unemployment to rise. Jobless workers cannot buy new cars, eat at restaurants, or perhaps even pay their rent. If the downward spiral picks up speed, a recession results. The Cost of Credit In the United States economy, consumers often use credit to purchase “big ticket” items&ndash;from new cars and houses to home electronics and vacations. The cost of credit is the interest rate that financial institutions charge their customers. If the interest rate rises, consumers are less likely to buy those new cars and appliances. Consumers who do purchase items using credit cards can find themselves paying much more for the items they buy because high interest rates and fees increase the cost. Businesses, too, look to interest rates in deciding whether or not to purchase new equipment, expand their facilities, or make many other large investments. When interest rates are low, companies are more willing to borrow money. When interest rates climb, business borrowing falls. One result of rising interest rates, then, is less output. Such a result may lead to a contraction phase. Consider one example of the impact of interest rates on the business cycle. In the early 1980s, high consumer interest rates helped bring on the worst economic slump in the United States since the Great Depression. Some credit card interest rates reached 21 percent. As a result, the cost of expensive items usually purchased using credit was too high for many Americans. With reduced consumer spending, the economy entered a recession that pushed >> In a downturn, consumers may have a harder time with credit card debt. Analyze Political Cartoons Why does the cartoonist portray the man as looking so nervous? unemployment rates over 9 percent&ndash;the highest since the Depression. Expectations Affect Spending Consumer spending is determined partly by consumers&apos; expectations. If people expect the economy to begin contracting, they may reduce their spending because they expect layoffs and lower incomes. This reduced spending can actually help bring on a contraction, as firms respond to reduced demand for their products. Thus consumer expectations often become self-fulfilling prophecies, creating the very outcome that consumers fear. In the summer of 2007, consumer confidence fell. By September, consumer confidence was the lowest it had been in two years. This low level of consumer confidence affected the holiday shopping season at the end of the year. High consumer confidence has the opposite effect on the economy. If people expect a rapidly growing economy, they will also expect abundant job opportunities and rising incomes. Thus, they will buy more goods and services, pushing up gross domestic product. Effects of External Shocks Of all the factors that affect the business cycle, perhaps most difficult to predict are external shocks. External shocks can 7.2 Business Cycles 303 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="370"> <text><![CDATA[ dramatically affect an economy&apos;s aggregate supply. Examples of negative external shocks include disruptions of the oil supply, wars that interrupt trade, and droughts that severely reduce crop harvests. Let&apos;s consider what might happen if a shock occurred. Suppose that the nation&apos;s supply of imported oil was suddenly cut off. Immediately, the price of any remaining oil would skyrocket. This rapid increase would have a powerful ripple effect on the economy. Oil is used to produce many goods, and petroleum products fuel the trucks, trains, and airplanes that transport goods from factories to stores. The oil shortage and high prices would force firms to reduce production and raise prices. In other words, GDP declines and the price level rises. This economic condition is particularly harmful to businesses and households, and is difficult for policymakers to fix. Of course, an economy may also enjoy positive external shocks. The discovery of a large deposit of oil or minerals will contribute to a nation&apos;s wealth. A growing season with a perfect mix of sun and rain may create bountiful harvests that drive food prices down. Positive shocks tend to shift the Aggregate Supply curve to the right, lowering the price level and increasing real GDP. >> When the business cycle that brought expansion in the 1920s began to contract, the Great Depression followed. External shocks usually come without much warning. The other key factors capable of pushing an economy from one phase of the business cycle to another are more predictable. So economists track business investment, interest rates, and consumer expectations in order to more accurately forecast new stages of the business cycle. INfER A major thunderstorm destroyed Midland Farm&apos;s summer crop of corn, greatly affecting the business&apos;s overall profits. What type of economic variable would this storm be considered? Forecasting Business Cycles Predicting changes in a business cycle is difficult. For example, in the summer of 1929, John J. Raskob, Senior Financial Officer of General Motors, declared his firm belief that the United States was on the verge of the greatest industrial expansion in its history. In my opinion the wealth of the country is bound to increase at a very rapid rate . . . . Anyone who believes that opportunities are now closed and that from now on the country will get worse instead of better is welcome to the opinion&ndash;and whatever increment it will bring. I think that we have scarcely started . . . . I am firm in my belief that anyone not only can be rich but ought to be rich. &ndash;John Jakob Raskob, interview in the Ladies Home Journal,August 1929 Less than two months later, the stock market crashed, setting off the worst depression in American history. Economists today know a lot more about the workings of our economy than Raskob did in 1929. However, economic predictions are still tricky. To predict the next phase of a business cycle, forecasters must anticipate movements in real GDP before they occur. This is no easy task, given the large number of factors that influence the level of output in a modern economy. Government and business decision makers need economic predictions to be accurate, however, so they can respond properly to changes in a business 304 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

If businesses expect a contraction, they may postpone building new factories. If government policymakers expect a contraction, they may take steps to try to prevent a recession. Economists have many tools available for making these predictions. The leading indicators are a set of key economic variables that provide economists with economic data to predict future trends in a business cycle, but as you can see in Figure 7.9 many factors can contribute to a recession. The stock market is one leading indicator. Typically, the stock market turns sharply downward before a recession begins. For example, the crash of the Nasdaq exchange in 2000 preceded the recession of 2001. Interest rates are another indicator. As you have seen, interest rates have a strong effect on consumer and business spending. The Conference Board, a private business research organization, maintains an index of economic data from the ten leading economic indicators, including stock prices, interest rates, and manufacturers&apos; new orders of capital goods. Economists and policymakers closely watch this index, which is updated monthly. However, like the other important tools used to forecast changes in the business cycle, it is not altogether reliable. IdENTIfy What do the stock market and interest rates have in common? Business Cycles in the United States Economic activity in the United States has indeed followed a cyclical pattern. Periods of GDP growth alternate with periods of GDP decline. The Great Depression As you read earlier, before the 1930s many economists believed that when an economy declined, it would quickly recover on its own. This explains why, when the U.S. stock market crashed in 1929, and the economy took a nosedive, President Herbert Hoover felt little need to change his economic policies. However, the Great Depression did not rapidly cure itself. Rather, it was the most severe economic downturn in the history of industrial capitalism. As Figure 7.10 indicates, the effects went beyond the United States. Between 1929 and 1933, GDP fell by about a quarter, and unemployment rose sharply. In fact, one out of every four American workers was jobless, and those who could find work often earned very low wages. As the effects of the Great Depression spread throughout the world, it affected economists&apos; beliefs about the macroeconomy. The Depression, along with the publication of John Maynard Keynes&apos;s The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, pushed economists to consider the idea that 7.2 Business Cycles 305 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="372"> <text><![CDATA[ modern market economies could fall into long-lasting contractions. In addition, many economists accepted Keynes&apos;s idea that government intervention might be needed to pull an economy out of a depression. You will read more about Keynes and his ideas later in this course. The Depression also affected American politics. Rejecting Hoover, voters in 1932 elected the Democratic governor of New York, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to the presidency. Roosevelt soon began a series of government programs, known as the New Deal, designed to get people back to work. Programs such as the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps got able-bodied workers back on the job and earning income, which they then spent supporting their families. In this way, spending increased throughout the economy. Still, although the New Deal relieved some of the effects of hard times, it did not end the Great Depression. Not until the United States entered into World War II did the economy achieve full recovery. The sudden surge in government defense spending boosted real GDP well above pre-Depression levels. More Recent Recessions Thankfully, no economic downturns since the 1930s have been nearly as severe as the Great Depression. We have had recessions, though.

These actions caused external shocks in the American oil market. As oil prices skyrocketed, raw material costs rose, and the economy quickly contracted into a period of stagflation. Reeling from higher-than-ever prices for gasoline and heating fuel, Americans began looking for ways to conserve energy. They turned down their heat; bought smaller, more fuel-efficient cars; and began researching energy alternatives to petroleum. When the United States and other nations developed more of their own energy resources, OPEC finally lowered its oil prices. As you read earlier, there was another recession in the early 1980s. High interest rates and other factors caused real GDP to fall and the unemployment rate to rise to over 9 percent in the early 1980s. Following a brief recession in 1991, the U.S. economy grew steadily, with real GDP rising each year during the 1990s. The country enjoyed record growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. Some economists began to suggest that the nature of the business cycle had changed. Perhaps we had learned how to control recessions and promote long-term growth. 1934 1935 1936 1937 >> Figure 7.10 Analyze Graphs Which nations had the highest and lowest levels of unemployment in 1930?

Explain your answer. Much of this growth was fueled by the rise of Internet companies, called “dot.coms,” after part of their Internet address. As the dot.com boom of the 1990s ended, however, U.S. economic growth slowed. Businesses and individuals invested billions of dollars in new technology that proved to be unprofitable and, in some cases, worthless. The negative effects of the technology crash spread throughout the economy to other industries. In March 2001, the country slipped into a recession. Economists hoped this decline would prove short- lived, but then the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, resulted in a sharp drop in consumer spending. The hotel, airline, and tourism industries were especially affected. Many companies blamed their performance problems on September 11. The Present-Day Business Cycle The recession ended in November 2001 when the economy began to grow slowly. Historically low interest rates prevented the economy from slipping back into a recession. However, unemployment continued to rise steadily over the following years as companies laid off more workers and kept spending low. Growth was not strong enough to dispel the feeling of bad times even though the recession had ended. The economy did recover, though. By late 2003, it was surging, with GDP growing at an annual rate of 7.5 percent over three months. After that, growth slowed, though it did continue. High gasoline prices in 2006 caused the economy&apos;s growth to slow even further. Difficulties in the home mortgage market spiraled into a financial crisis and economic recession in 2008.

He put in place a series of government programs known as the New Deal. The goal of these programs was to help struggling Americans and to boost the economy. In 1940, Roosevelt ran as a Democrat for re-election to a third term. A key issue in the campaign was the New Deal. Thomas and Doris Reed published a summary of Republican positions in May 1940. Roosevelt responded in a speech in Brooklyn in November 1940. >>New Deal programs meant to help Americans like these, waiting on line for bread during the Depression. The Republican Opposition: Thomas H. Reed and Doris D. Reed . . .

It is the poor who will be cared for by a solvent government. It is the poor who will suffer most when the government goes into bankruptcy.” . . .

Economic growth enables an entire society to make major improvements in its quality of life. The basic measure of a nation&apos;s economic growth rate is the percentage of change in real GDP over a period of time. For example, real GDP in 1996 was $8.3 trillion, and in 2006, it was $11.3 trillion. The economic growth rate for this decade was about 36 percent ($11.3 trillion – $8.3 trillion) ÷ $8.3 trillion x 100). GDP and Population Growth To satisfy the needs of a growing population, real GDP must grow at least as fast as the population does. This is one reason that economists prefer a measure that takes population growth into account. For this, they rely on real GDP per capita, which is real GDP divided by the total population of a country (per capitameans “for each person”). Figure 7.11 shows growth in real GDP per capita. Real GDP per capita is considered the most accurate measure of a nation&apos;s standard of living. As long as real GDP is rising faster than the population, real GDP per capita will rise, and so will the standard of living. Economists can see how the standard of living has changed over time by comparing real GDP per capita from two VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

GDP and Quality of Life GDP measures standard of living, which relates to material goods. We cannot use it, however, to measure people&apos;s quality of life. GDP excludes many factors that affect the quality of life, such as the state of the environment or the level of stress people feel in their daily lives. In addition, while real GDP per capita represents the average output per person in an economy, it tells us nothing about how that output is distributed across the population. There are a number of ways that economists measure how income is distributed in the United States, such as “personal income distribution” and “functional income distribution.” These measures, while complicated, are important. If most of the income in a nation goes to relatively few people while the majority earn next to nothing, the typical person will not enjoy a very high standard of living even if the real GDP per capita figure is high. Despite these facts, real GDP per capita is a good starting point for measuring a nation&apos;s quality of life. People who live in nations with greater availability of goods and services usually enjoy better nutrition, safer and more comfortable housing, lower infant mortality, longer life spans, better education, greater job opportunities, and other indicators of a favorable quality of life. Since economic growth has an enormous impact on quality of life, economists devote significant resources to figuring out what causes a nation&apos;s real GDP to rise. They focus on the roles of capital goods, technology, and a few related factors. ANALyzE INfORMATION How is high GDP per capita linked to quality of life? Capital Deepening Physical capital, the equipment used to produce goods and services, makes an important contribution to the output of an economy. With more physical capital, each worker can be more productive, producing more output per hour of work. Economists use the term labor productivityto describe the amount of output produced per worker. Even if the size of the labor force does not change, more physical capital will lead to more output&ndash;in other words, to economic growth. This process of increasing the amount of capital per worker, called capital deepening, is one of the most important sources of growth in modern economies. (See Figure 7.12.) This process is also known as capital formation. Human capital, the productive knowledge and skills acquired by a worker through education and experience, also contributes to output. Firms, and employees themselves, can deepen human U.S. Real GDP (trillions of 2005 dollars) Sources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis; U.S. Census REAL GDP REAL GDP PER CAPITA POPULATION The growth in a nation&apos;s economy is measured by change to its real GDP.

Along with increasing output per worker, capital deepening tends to increase job opportunities and workers&apos; earnings. To understand why this happens, consider the effect of greater worker productivity on the demand for workers. If workers can produce more output per hour, they become more valuable to their employers. As a result, employers will demand more workers. This increase in demand will increase the equilibrium wage rate in the labor market. Therefore, with a labor force of a given size, capital deepening will increase output and workers&apos; wages. How, then, does an economy increase its stock of capital per worker? It does so through saving and investment. dRAw CONCLUSIONS Why does capital deepening work with human capital? Saving and Investment To see how saving and investment are related, consider an economy with no government sector and no foreign trade. In this simplified economy, consumers and business firms purchase all output. In other words, output can be used for consumption (by consumers) or investment (by firms). Income that is not used for consumption is called saving. Since output can only be consumed or invested, whatever is not consumed must be invested. Therefore, in this simplified economy, saving is equal to investment. The proportion of disposable income that is saved is called the savings rate. To see this another way, look at an individual&apos;s decision, as shown in Figure 7.13. Shawna had an after-tax income of $30,000 last year, but she spent only $25,000. That left her with $5,000 available for saving. She used some of her leftover income to purchase shares in a mutual fund, giving her ownership of some stocks and bonds. She put the rest of the money into a savings account at her bank. Through her mutual-fund firm, her bank, and other intermediaries, Shawna&apos;s $5,000 was made available to businesses. The firms used the money to invest in new plants and equipment. So, when Shawna chose not to spend her entire income, the amount that she saved became available for business investment. If we consider the economy as a whole, the process works the same way. If total saving rises, more investment funds become available to businesses. This accumulation of savings made available for investment is called capital formation. Those firms will use most of these funds for capital investment. That is, they will expand the stock of capital in the business sector. CAPITAL DEEPENING Capital deepening occurs when businesses buy machines and equipment that lead to greater worker productivity. Increased productivity leads to increased demand for workers, higher wages, and economic growth. + INCREASED LABOR PRODUCTIVITY Better-trained workers use improved equipment to produce more. INCREASED for the company and economic INCREASED INCREASED OUTPUT More productive workers lead to increased output growth. LABOR DEMAND Economic growth leads employers to demand more workers.

Shawna&apos;s income: $30,000 $25,000 spent $5,000 saved MONEY SAVED OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH MONEY AVAILABLE FOR BUSINESS INVESTMENT >> Figure 7.13 Analyze Charts What actually happens to the money Shawna saves? Higher saving, then, leads to higher investment, and thus to higher amounts of capital per worker. In other words, higher saving leads to capital deepening, or capital formation. Now we can understand why most nations promote saving. In the long run, more saving will lead to higher output and income for the population, raising GDP and the standard of living. The United States has a low savings rate. To obtain the investment funds they need, businesses and the government borrow from other countries with higher savings rates. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT How is saving linked to capital deepening? The Effects of Population, Government, and Trade Now we will consider a slightly more realistic economy that has population growth, a government sector, and foreign trade. First, think about the effect of population growth on capital accumulation. Population Growth Population growth does not necessarily preclude economic growth. However, if the population grows while the supply of capital remains constant, the amount of capital per worker will shrink. This process, the opposite of capital deepening, leads to lower living standards. In fact, some relatively poor countries, such as Bangladesh, have large labor forces but small capital stocks. The result is that output per worker&ndash; and earnings per worker&ndash;are relatively low. Conversely, a nation with low population growth and expanding capital stock will enjoy significant capital deepening. Government Government can affect capital formation in several ways. If government raises tax rates to pay for additional services or to finance a war, households will have less money. People will reduce saving, thus reducing the money available to businesses for investment. In these cases, the government is taxing households in order to pay for its own consumption spending. The net effect is reduced investment. On the other hand, a different result occurs if government invests the extra tax revenues in public goods such as roads and telecommunications. These public goods are called infrastructure, the underlying necessities of modern life. Spending on infrastructure increases investment. To see why, consider what share of income the average household saves. Suppose that, on average, households save 10 percent of their income. In this case, for every extra dollar in tax revenue the government collects, 7.3 Economic Growth 313 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="380"> <text><![CDATA[ household saving (and investment) drops by 10 cents. However, government investment in infrastructure rises by $1. The net result is an increase in total investment of 90 cents. This kind of spending, then, is capital deepening, since the government is taxing its citizens to provide investment goods. Foreign Trade Foreign trade can result in a trade deficit, a situation in which the value of goods a country imports is higher than the value of goods it exports. Running a trade deficit may not seem like a wise practice, but if the imports consist of investment goods, the practice can foster capital deepening. Investment goods are the structures and equipment purchased by businesses. Capital deepening can offset the negative effects of a trade deficit by helping to generate economic growth, helping a country pay back the money it borrowed in the first place. In the mid-1800s, for example, the United States financed the building of the transcontinental railroad in part by borrowing funds from investors in other countries. The borrowing created a trade deficit, but it also helped create a much higher rate of economic growth than would have occurred otherwise. The railroad promoted new industries and opened up vast areas to farming, leading to a huge increase in the nation&apos;s farm output. >> Port dredging is an example of investment in infrastructure. Dredging deepens the port, which allows larger ships and increased trade. Of course, not all trade deficits promote capital deepening. In this regard, trade deficits are similar to government taxation. Whether they encourage capital deepening and economic growth depends on how the funds are used. If they are used for short- term consumption, the economy will not grow any faster, and it will not have any additional GDP to pay back the debts. If the funds are used for longterm investment, however, they will foster capital deepening. The resulting economic growth will bring the country prosperity in the future. Trade can support economic growth by helping countries focus on producing what they are best at producing (having either an absolute advantage or a comparative advantage) and trading it, while buying other goods that they cannot produce as easily. Trade that results in importing goods can provide an economy with resources it might not otherwise have, which helps the economy grow. Exporting goods can enlarge a market for those goods, creating a stronger economy that is built on access to bigger markets. For example, a nation with access to the sea might develop a strong fishing industry and export some of the catch to a landlocked country. The landlocked country might have abundant forests from which to export wood products. Such trade can grow the economies of both countries. Trade is essential for economies to specialize in what they are most efficient at producing. ExPRESS IdEAS CLEARLy Do higher taxes increase or reduce investment? Technological Progress Another key source of economic growth is technological progress. This term usually brings to mind new inventions or new ways of performing a task, but in economics, it has a more precise definition. Technological progress is an increase in efficiency gained by producing more output without using more inputs. Technological progress occurs in many ways. It can result from new scientific knowledge&ndash;for example, nanotechnology, making computer chips smaller and smaller&ndash;that has practical uses. It can be a new invention that allows workers to produce goods more efficiently. It could even be a new method for organizing production. All of these advances raise a nation&apos;s productivity. Increased productivity means producing more output with the same amounts of land, labor, and capital. With technological progress, a society enjoys higher real GDP per capita, which leads to a higher standard of living. 314 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Technological Progress contributes 1.02% Capital contributes 0.56% 2.92% SOURCE: Edward Denison, Economist >> Analyze Graphs According to the graph, about what fraction of the average annual growth rate of real GDP from 1929 to 1982 was due to technological progress? Bounce to Activate Gallery Measuring Technological Progress In most modern economies, the amount of physical and human capital changes all the time. So do the quantity and quality of labor and the technology used to produce goods and services. These interconnected variables work together to produce economic growth. How, then, can we isolate and measure the effects of technological progress? Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize–winning economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a method for doing so. Solow&apos;s method was to determine how much growth in output comes from increases in capital and how much comes from increases in labor. He concluded that any remaining growth in output must then come from technological progress. Between 1929 and 1982, the average annual growth rate of real GDP was 2.92 percent. Using Solow&apos;s method, economist Edward Denison has estimated that technological progress boosted the real GDP 1.02 percent per year, on average. Denison determined that increases in capital and labor were responsible for 0.56 percent and 1.34 percent of the average annual growth, respectively (2.92 &ndash; 0.56 &ndash;1.34 = 1.02). Technological progress, then, was the second most important factor in promoting economic growth in that period. Causes of Technological Progress Since technological progress is such an important source of economic growth, economists have looked for its causes. They have found a variety of factors that influence technological progress. Scientific research Scientific research can generate new or improved production techniques, improve physical capital, and result in better goods and services. Innovation When new products and ideas are successfully brought to the market, output goes up, boosting GDP and business profits. Yet innovation often requires costly research. Companies willing to carry out that research need assurance that they will profit from the products they develop. The government issues patents to provide that assurance. A patent is a set of exclusive rights to produce and sell a product for a particular period of time. It is given to people who can show that they have discovered or invented a new product or process. Currently, patents last 20 years. A patent helps a company recover the cost of research by earning profits before its competitors can copy its new products. Government aids innovation in several other ways as well. Through organizations such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, the United States government sponsors basic research. This term describes theoretical research that is often expensive and might not bring a new product to market in a timely way. 7.3 Economic Growth 315 ]]></text>

Scale of the market Larger markets provide more incentives for innovation, since the potential profits are greater. For this reason, larger economies will come up with more technological advances. Education and experience As you read earlier, firms increase their human capital by providing education and on-the-job experience for their employees. Human capital makes workers more productive, which accelerates economic growth. It can also stimulate growth in another way. A more educated and experienced workforce can more easily handle technological advances and may well create some new advances, too. Natural resource use Increased use of natural resources can create a need for new technology. For example, new technology can turn previously useless raw materials into usable resources. It can also allow us to obtain and use resources more efficiently, develop substitute resources, and discover new resource reserves. Because price is based on the cost of obtaining a resource (and not necessarily on its scarcity), new technology can also lead to lower prices.

General economic conditions, lengthy job searches, and seasonal production schedules are some of the factors that cause unemployment. Economists look at four categories of unemployment: frictional, seasonal, structural, and cyclical. Sometimes, factors outside the economy can cause unemployment. The various kinds of unemployment have different effects on the economy as well as on the people who are unemployed. Frictional Unemployment Unemployment always exists, even in a booming economy. Frictional unemployment occurs when people take time to find a job. For example, people might change jobs, be laid off from their current jobs, or need some time to find the right position after they finish their schooling. They might be returning to the workforce after a long period of time. In the following examples, all three people are considered frictionally unemployed. Hannah was not satisfied working as a nurse in a large hospital. Last month she left her job to look for a position at a small health clinic.

Liz left her sales job two years ago to care for an aging parent. Now she is trying to return to the workforce. None of these three people found work immediately. While they look for work, they are frictionally unemployed. In the large, diverse U.S. economy, economists expect to find many people in this category. Unemployment insurance, which provides income to laid-off workers seeking new jobs, may contribute slightly to frictional unemployment. A worker receiving unemployment insurance faces somewhat less financial pressure to find a new job immediately. Structural Unemployment The structure of the American economy has changed over time. Two centuries ago, people needed basic farming skills to survive. As the country developed an industrial economy, farm workers moved to urban areas to work in factories. Today, service industries are rapidly replacing manufacturing industries, and information services are expanding at breakneck speed. >> Maria Contreras-Sweet was nominated to head the U.S. Small Business Administration in January 2014. According to the SBA, small businesses create two out of three new jobs. All these shifts lead to upheavals in the labor market. When the structure of the economy changes, the skills that workers need to succeed also change. Workers who lack the necessary skills lose their jobs. Structural unemployment occurs when workers&apos; skills do not match those needed for the jobs that are now available. There are five major causes of structural unemployment. The development of new technology New inventions and ideas often push out older ways of doing things. For example, downloading music has hurt the sales of compact discs. Firms making CDs have let workers go, and those workers must find jobs in another field. The discovery of new resources New resources replace old resources. The discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania in 1859 severely hurt the whale-oil industry. Whaling-ship crews lost their jobs and did not have the skills needed for the petroleum industry. Changes in consumer demand Consumers often stop buying one product in favor of another. Many people now favor athletic shoes over more traditional kinds of shoes. As a result, traditional shoemaking jobs have declined. Globalization The mobility of capital and labor has fueled a shift from local to international markets. Countries have become more open to foreign trade and investment in a trend called globalization. As a result, companies often relocate jobs or entire facilities to other countries where costs are lower. Celia, for example, spent many years working on an automobile assembly line in Michigan. When her company moved much of its auto assembly work to Mexico, where labor is less expensive, Celia lost her job. Unfortunately, there were no local jobs that matched Celia&apos;s skills. Lack of education People who drop out of school or fail to acquire the minimum skills needed for today&apos;s job market may find themselves unemployed, employed part time, or stuck in low-wage jobs. For example, Martin barely managed to graduate from high school. When he was hired as a clerk by a local clothing store, he had trouble using the computerized checkout register. The store manager fired Martin after just two months because he lacked the skills needed for the job. Policymakers in the 1990s and 2000s recognized that computer technology, globalization, and other structural changes threatened the futures of many workers. As a result, they developed job-training programs to help workers gain new skills, especially computer skills. 318 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Some companies offer their own training programs. In this way, they can teach trainees the specialized skills they need to become valued employees. Seasonal Unemployment Gregory is a brick mason for a small construction company in the northeastern United States. Every winter Gregory&apos;s employer lays off all seven of his employees when cold weather forces an end to outdoor work. In the spring, he hires them back again for the new construction season. Gregory and his co-workers are examples of people who experience seasonal unemployment. In general, seasonal unemployment occurs when industries slow or shut down for a season or make seasonal shifts in their production schedules. Seasonal unemployment can also occur as a result of harvest schedules or vacations. When this school year ends, you or your friends may need some time to find the perfect summer job. Until you do so, economists will count you as seasonally unemployed. As with frictional unemployment, economists expect to see seasonal unemployment throughout the year. Government policymakers do not take steps to prevent this kind of unemployment, because it is a normal part of a healthy economy. Still, the lives of seasonally unemployed workers can be extremely difficult. Migrant agricultural workers, for example, travel throughout the country to pick fruits and vegetables as various crops come into season. They know that their work will likely end when winter arrives. Migrant workers can also have periods of unemployment even during harvest season, depending on the weather. Heat, cold, rain, and drought can ruin harvest schedules by causing fruits and vegetables to ripen sooner or later than expected. Instead of moving smoothly from crop to crop, migrant workers might lose work time waiting for a crop to be ready for picking. Cyclical Unemployment Unemployment that rises during economic downturns and falls when the economy improves is called cyclical unemployment. During recessions, or downturns in the business cycle, the demand for goods and services drops. The resulting slowdown in production causes the demand for labor to drop as well, and companies begin to lay off employees. Many of these laid-off employees will be rehired when the recession ends and the business cycle >> A counselor at a summer day camp is an example of a seasonal worker. Bounce to Activate Chart resumes an upward trend. Although economists expect cyclical unemployment, it can severely strain the economy and greatly distress the unemployed. The most damaging example of cyclical unemployment in the twentieth century was the Great Depression. During the Great Depression, one out of every four workers was unemployed. Many remained jobless for years. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed, and Congress passed, the Social Security Act. In addition to providing monthly payments for retirees and people who could not support themselves, the Social Security Act established a program of unemployment insurance. Today, unemployment insurance still provides weekly payments to workers who have lost their jobs. The payments usually provide about half of a worker&apos;s lost wages each week for a limited amount of time. Circumstances Outside the Economy Sometimes events outside the economy can cause unemployment. The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon cost the country an estimated 1.5 to 2 million jobs. Many of the lost jobs were in the travel and tourism industries. 7.4 Unemployment 319 ]]></text>

In Manhattan, the area around the World Trade Center site was hit especially hard, and New York City lost some 150,000 jobs. Natural disasters also affect employment. In October 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast region. The powerful storm caused widespread destruction, and thousands of people lost their jobs. Many families were relocated to other areas while their communities were being rebuilt. Months later, unemployment among people affected by Hurricane Katrina was still higher than the national average. COMPARE ANd CONTRAST How is cyclical unemployment different from seasonal unemployment? The Unemployment Rate The amount of unemployment in the nation is an important clue to the health of the economy. For this reason, the government keeps careful track of how many people are unemployed, and why. To measure employment, the United States Bureau of the Census conducts a monthly household survey for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). For this survey, called the Current Population Survey, interviewers poll 60,000 families about employment during that month. This sample is designed to represent the entire population of the United States. The BLS, a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor, analyzes the data from the survey to identify how many people are employed and how many are unemployed. Using these numbers, the BLS computes the unemployment rate, or the percentage of the nation&apos;s labor force that is unemployed. Interpreting the Unemployment Rate The labor force is composed of civilians age 16 and older who have a job or are actively looking for a job. To determine the unemployment rate, BLS officials add up the number of employed and unemployed people. That figure equals the total labor force. Then they divide the number of unemployed people by the total labor force and multiply by 100. The result is the percentage of people who are unemployed. For example, in September 2007, the Current Population Survey showed that 146.3 million people were employed, and 7.2 million were unemployed. The total labor force, therefore, was 153.5 million.

Bounce to Activate Chart Adjusting the Unemployment Rate When you see the unemployment rate for a particular month, it has usually been “seasonally adjusted.” This means that the rate has been increased or decreased to take into account the level of seasonal unemployment. Taking this step allows economists to more accurately compare unemployment rates from month to month. This comparison helps them better detect changing economic conditions. The unemployment rate is only an average for the nation. It does not reflect regional differences. Some areas, such as the coal-mining region of Appalachia in the southeastern United States, have long had a higher-than-average unemployment rate. The BLS and individual state agencies therefore establish unemployment rates for states and other geographic areas. These rates help pinpoint trouble areas on which policymakers can focus attention. ExPLAIN Why do states keep track of their own unemployment rates? The Goal of Full Employment Zero unemployment is not an achievable goal in a market economy, even under the best of circumstances. Economists generally agree that in an economy that is working properly, an unemployment rate of around 4 to 6 percent is normal. Such an economy would still experience frictional, seasonal, and structural unemployment. In other words, full employment is the level of employment reached when no cyclical unemployment exists. Underemployment Full employment means that nearly everyone who wants a job has a job. But are all those people satisfied with their jobs? Not necessarily. Some people working at low-skill, low- wage jobs may be highly skilled or educated in a field with few opportunities. They are underemployed, that is, working at a job for which they are overqualified, or working part time when they desire full-time work. For example, Jim, a philosophy major, earned a graduate degree in philosophy. When he left school, Jim found that although the economy was booming, he could not find jobs in which he could apply his knowledge of philosophy. Jim found a part-time job that did not pay well and did not challenge his mind. He was underemployed. Underemployment also describes the situation of people who want a permanent, full-time job but have not been able to find one. Many part-time workers and seasonal workers fit into this category. 7.4 Unemployment 321 ]]></text>

These discouraged workers have stopped searching for employment and may rely on other family members or savings to support them. Although they are without jobs, discouraged workers do not appear in the unemployment rate determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because they are not actively looking for work. If underemployed and discouraged workers were included, the unemployment rate would be much higher than reported. Some estimates are that the 2009 unemployment rate would have been above 17 percent. United States economic policy encourages full employment in various ways. Monetary and fiscal policies, for example, aim to promote strong but sustainable growth, which in turn will keep employment rates high. Full employment benefits individuals and society as a whole because more people can provide for themselves and their families and pay taxes. Full employment also benefits the economy as a whole because employed people are better able to save and invest money, leading to capital formation. The federal government also spends money to improve infrastructure such as highways. Such projects promote fuller employment and increasing economic output due to the improved infrastructure. These projects come at the cost, however, of higher eventual taxes to cover the projects&apos; costs.

Inflation Josephine and Jack Barrow have owned the same house for 50 years. Recently, they had a real estate agent estimate their home&apos;s present market value. The Barrows were astounded. The house that they had bought for $12,000 was now worth nearly $150,000&ndash;a rise in value of more than 1,100 percent. How could the value of a house, or anything else, increase so much? The main reason is inflation. Inflation is a general increase in prices across an economy. Over the years, prices generally go up. Since World War II, real estate prices have risen greatly. The Barrows were pleased their house was worth so much. Then they realized that inflation had raised the prices of all houses, just as it had also raised wages and the prices of most other goods and services. As a result, they could not buy a similar house in their area for $12,000 or even $120,000.

    <page pageNumber="390"> <text><![CDATA[ Purchasing Power Another way to look at the Barrows&apos; situation is that inflation had shrunk the value, or purchasing power, of the Barrows&apos; money. Purchasing power is the ability to purchase goods and services. As prices rise, the purchasing power of money declines. That is why $12,000 buys much less now than it did 50 years ago. gENERATE ExPLANATIONS Why does inflation cause purchasing power to decrease over time? Price Indexes Housing costs are just one element that economists consider when they interpret economic data that reflect inflation and other price changes. The economy has thousands of goods and services, with millions of individual prices. How do economists compare the changes in all these prices in order to measure inflation? The answer is that they do not compare individual prices; instead, they compare price levels. Price level is the cost of goods and services in the entire economy at a given point in time. To help them calculate price level, economists use a price index. A price index is a measurement that shows how the average price of a standard group of goods changes over time. A price index produces an average that economists compare to earlier averages to see how much prices have changed over time. How Price Indexes Are Used Price indexes help consumers and business owners make economic decisions. For example, after Marina read in the newspaper that prices for consumer goods had been Food Prices in Dollars, 1990–2010* rising, she increased the amount of money she was saving for a new car. She wanted to be sure that when the time came to buy the car, she had saved enough money to pay for it. The government also uses indexes in making policy decisions. A member of Congress, for example, might push for an increase in the minimum wage if she thinks inflation has reduced purchasing power. The Consumer Price Index Although there are several price indexes, the best-known index focuses on consumers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is computed each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CPI is determined by measuring the price of a standard group of goods meant to represent the “market basket” of a typical urban consumer. This market basket is a representative collection of goods and services. By looking at the CPI, consumers, businesses, and the government can compare the cost of a group of goods this month with what the same or a similar group cost months or even years ago. As you can see from Figure 7.14, the CPI market basket is divided into eight categories of goods and services. These categories, and a few examples of the many items in each, are shown. About every ten years, the items in the market basket are updated to account for shifting consumer buying habits. The BLS determines how the market basket should change by conducting a Consumer Expenditure Survey. The BLS conducted one such survey from 2000 to 2001, collecting spending information from 10,000 families. Another 7,500 families kept diaries, noting everything they purchased during a two-week period for both years. This process created the list of market basket items used today.

Why? Calculating the Inflation Rate Economists also find it useful to calculate the inflation rate&ndash;the percentage rate of change in price level over time. The inflation rate can be calculated between any two points in time, typically between two years. An inflation rate calculated from one year to the next gives a snapshot of current economic conditions. An inflation rate calculated from many years ago to today shows how inflation has changed over a longer period of time. To calculate the inflation rate, use the following formula: CPI for Year A – CPI for Year B/ CPI for Year B x 100. Since the CPI is the most familiar price index, we will focus on it. How does the BLS determine the CPI and use it to calculate the inflation rate? Calculating CPI To determine the CPI, the BLS establishes a base period to which it can compare current prices. Currently, the base period is 1982–1984. The cost of the market basket for that period is assigned the index number 100. Every month, BLS representatives update the cost of the same market basket of goods and services by rechecking all the prices. Each updated cost is compared with the base-period cost to determine the index for that month. As costs rise, the index rises. The BLS determines the CPI for a given year using the following formula: CPI = updated cost ÷ base-period cost x 100 For example, suppose the market basket cost $200 during the base period and costs $360 today. The CPI for today would be: $360 ÷ $200 x 100 = 180 In this example, the CPI rose from 100 in the base period to 180 today. Types of Inflation Inflation rates in the United States have changed greatly over time as you can see in Figure 7.15 . When the inflation rate stays low&ndash;between 1 and 3 percent&ndash;it does not typically cause problems for the economy. In this environment, businesses and governments can make plans. When the inflation rate exceeds 5 percent, however, the inflation rate itself becomes unstable and unpredictable. This makes planning very difficult. Sometimes the inflation rate spikes sharply, as in 1974 and 1980. These sharp increases in the inflation rate were due in part to increases in prices in world food and oil markets. In order to study long-term trends in the inflation rate, analysts need to set aside temporary spikes in food and fuel prices. To do this, economists have developed the concept of a core inflation rate. The core inflation rate is the rate of inflation excluding the effects of food and energy prices. By far the worst kind of inflation is hyperinflation, or inflation that is out of control. During periods of hyperinflation, inflation rates can go as high as 100 or even 500 percent per month, and money loses much of its value. This level of inflation is rare, but when it occurs it often leads to a total economic collapse. CONSTRUCT How is the Consumer Price Index calculated? 7.5 Inflation and Deflation 325 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="392"> <text><![CDATA[ Identifying Causes of Inflation Where does inflation come from? Price levels can rise steeply when demand for goods and services exceeds the supply available at current prices, such as during wartime. They can also rise steeply when productivity is restricted&ndash;for example, when a long drought leads to poor harvests. Nobody can explain every instance of rising price levels. However, economists have several theories about the causes of inflation. These include the growth of the money supply, changes in aggregate demand, and changes in aggregate supply. Economists look at all of these elements when they try to understand the inflation process. Growth of the Money Supply The quantity theory of inflation states that too much money in the economy causes inflation. Therefore, the money supply should be carefully monitored to keep it in line with the nation&apos;s productivity as measured by real GDP. Economists at the University of Chicago developed a popular version of this theory in the 1950s and 1960s. They maintained that the money supply could be used to control price levels in the long term. The key to stable prices, they said, was to increase the supply of money at the same rate as the economy was growing. Inflation Rate, 1970–2010 Changes in Aggregate Demand Aggregate demand is the amount of goods and services in the economy that will be purchased at all possible price levels. Inflation can occur when demand for goods and services exceeds existing supplies. During wartime, for example, the government&apos;s need for military supplies puts pressure on producers. The heavy demand for new equipment, supplies, and services increases the value of those items, pushing prices up. Wages also rise as the demand for labor increases along with the demand for goods. Changes in Aggregate Supply Finally, inflation occurs when producers raise prices in order to meet increased costs. Higher prices for raw materials can cause costs to increase. Wage increases, however, are most often the biggest reason, because wages are the largest single production cost for most companies. One cause of wage increases is low unemployment. Employers must then offer higher wages to attract and retain workers. Wage increases can also occur as a result of collective bargaining. For example, Jen is a union laborer at Am-Gro Fertilizer. The union she belongs to recently won a large wage increase from the company. The increased cost for labor led Am-Gro to raise its prices in order to maintain its profits. Such a situation can lead to a spiral of ever-higher prices, because one increase in costs leads to an increase in prices, which leads to another increase Percent change per year 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 14 8 10 12 6 4 0 2 Year SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics High fuel and food prices >> Figure 7.15 Analyze Graphs According to the graph, when was the last time inflation topped 4 percent? 326 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges Bounce to Activate Gallery ]]></text>

The effect of a wage-price spiral on Am-Gro Fertilizer is shown in Figure 7.16. IdENTIfy Which three factors affect inflation? Interpreting Effects of Inflation High inflation is a major economic problem, especially when inflation rates change greatly from year to year. Buyers and sellers find planning for the future difficult, if not impossible. The effects of inflation can be seen mainly in purchasing power, income, and interest rates. Effects on Purchasing Power You have seen, in the example of Jack and Josephine Barrow&apos;s house, how inflation can erode purchasing power. In an inflationary economy, a dollar will not buy the same number of goods that it did in years past. When there is no inflation, $1 buys the same amount of goods it did in the previous year. If the inflation rate is 10 percent this year, however, $1 will buy the equivalent of only $.90 worth of goods today. In this case, the purchasing power of a dollar has fallen. Effects on Income Inflation sometimes, but not always, erodes income. If wage increases match the inflation rate, a worker&apos;s real income stays the same. People who do not receive their income as wages, such as doctors, lawyers, and businesspeople, can often increase their incomes by raising the prices they charge in order to keep up with inflation. Not all people are so fortunate. If workers&apos; wages do not increase as much as inflation does, they are in a worse economic position than before. Since prices are higher, their income has less purchasing power. People living on a fixed income are hit especially hard by inflation. A fixed income is income that does not increase even when prices go up. The Barrows, for example, who are retired, are hurt by high inflation. The portion of their income from Social Security payments rises with the price level, because the government raises Social Security benefits to keep up with inflation. Much of their income, however, comes from a pension fund that pays them a fixed amount of money each month. Inflation steadily eats away at the real value of that pension check.

For example, Sonia had her savings in an account that paid 7 percent interest. At the same time, the annual inflation rate was 5 percent. As a result, the purchasing power of Sonia&apos;s savings increased that year by only 2 percent, because 5 percent of her interest was needed to keep up with inflation. When a bank&apos;s interest rate matches the inflation rate, savers break even. The amount they gain from interest is taken away by inflation. However, if the inflation rate is higher than the bank&apos;s interest rate, savers lose money. Effects on National Economies In the 1970s and early 1980s, the United States experienced high inflation. Prices rose at times more than 10% per year. People with savings and fixed incomes saw the value of their money fall. As a result, inflation discouraged savings and investment, and economic growth suffered. More recently, countries such as Brazil and Zimbabwe have experienced hyperinflation, with prices sometimes doubling every day. When inflation is this high, people rush to spend any money they earn. Saving, borrowing, and investment are impossible, and an economic crisis causes widespread suffering. ANALyzE dATA What is the true return on a savings account for the year if the interest rate is 6 percent and the inflation rate is 2 percent? Recent Trends in the Rate of Inflation Americans under age 30 have experienced fairly low inflation rates for most of their lifetimes. In the late 1990s, unemployment levels were low. Deflation As the economy entered a period of recession and slow growth in the 2000s, inflation fell to less than 2 percent. Rising unemployment and falling capital investment removed two factors that might have led to inflation due to increases in aggregate supply. Prices at times seemed to be falling. Some experts even predicted a period of deflation, or a sustained drop in the price level. However, the economy recovered. Although inflation remained relatively low through 2007, by mid-2008, soaring energy costs had pushed the inflation rate past 4 percent. The 2008 Recession By the end of 2008, the economy was in crisis. A severe recession led to a slowdown in economic activity. Global demand for oil dropped, and the price of gasoline plunged by 30 percent in one month. The CPI was 3 percent lower than it had been just three months earlier. The record decline in retail prices and sales put added pressure on the federal government to solve the economic crisis and avoid a renewed threat of deflation.

As you have read, the United States Bureau of the Census conducts extensive surveys to gather data about the American people. Its economists then analyze the data and organize them to reveal important characteristics. One key feature they look at is how many families and households live in poverty.

The poverty threshold is the income level below which income is insufficient to support a family or household. The poverty threshold, or poverty line, varies with the size of the family. For example, in 2013, the poverty threshold for a single parent under age 65 with one child was $15,510. For a family of four with two children, it was $23,550. If a family&apos;s total income is below the poverty threshold, everyone in the family is counted as poor. The Census Bureau determines how many people and families are living below the poverty line. Measuring Poverty Trends in the national poverty rate are shown in Figure 7.17. The poverty rate is the percentage of people who live in households with income below the official poverty threshold. Poverty rates for various groups are shown in Figure 7.18. We can use poverty rates to discover whom the government considers to be poor and what factors seem to contribute to poverty. Poverty rates differ sharply by groups, according to several different indicators: Race and ethnic origin The poverty rate among African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans is more than twice the rate for white Americans.

Age The percentage of children living in poverty is significantly larger than that for any other age group. Adults between the ages of 18 and 64 are the next largest group. Residence Inner-city residents have double the poverty rate of those who live outside the inner city. People who live in rural areas also have a higher poverty rate, especially in regions where job prospects are limited. dEfINE What is the poverty rate? What Causes Poverty? Put simply, a family is poor when the adults in the family fail to earn enough income to provide for its members&apos; basic needs. This failure to earn adequate income is often the result of unemployment. Millions of Americans are unemployed for a variety of reasons. While they are out of a job, their families might well fall below the poverty threshold. Many other poor adults are not even considered a part of the labor force. Some suffer from chronic health problems or disabilities that prevent them from working. Others are discouraged workers who are no longer looking for work. Many poor adults do have jobs, however. In fact, more than half of poor households have someone who works at least part time, and one in five have a full- time, year-round worker. For these “working poor,” the problem is usually low wages or a limited work schedule, rather than the lack of a job. For example, Ray makes $9 an hour as a full-time clerk in a clothing store. While he is at work, his wife stays at home with their two young children. Although Ray works 40 hours per week, and his salary is well above the minimum wage, his annual earnings amount to just $18,720, which is below the poverty threshold for a family of four. Economists agree that poverty and lack of income go hand in hand, but they have different ideas about the causes of poverty. Here are some of the most important explanations for why some people are poor. Changes in Family Structure Single-parent families are more likely to live in poverty than two- parent families. That is especially the case when the lone parent is a single mother. The divorce rate has risen significantly since the 1960s, as has the number of children born to unmarried parents. 330 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Which groups have the lowest? These demographic shifts tend to result in more single-parent families and more children living in poverty. Where People Live In most American cities, racial minorities are concentrated in the inner cities, far from the higher-wage jobs in suburban areas. Many of these inner-city residents do not own cars, and mass-transit systems are often not an efficient means of commuting from the inner city to the suburbs. As a result, people who live in the inner city earn less than people living outside the inner city. Similar obstacles exist for many people living in rural areas, where there is little business or industry. Unequal Treatment White workers generally earn higher salaries than minority workers, and men generally earn more than women. Much of this income inequality can be explained by differences in hours worked, education, and work experience. Part of the inequality, however, results from racial and gender discrimination. Even when all the workers in a group are equally productive, whites are often paid more than African Americans, and men are often paid more than women. Economists agree, however, that discrimination based on race or gender has been diminishing. Low-Wage Service Jobs In the past, less- educated people could earn good wages working in manufacturing jobs. Globalization, the decline in manufacturing, and the rise of the service economy have led to a decline in the number of higher- paying manufacturing jobs. More workers with less education now work in low-skill service jobs, where wages are often not as high as they are for factory jobs. Lack of Education The median income in 2011 for full-time workers between the ages of 25 and 34 who did not complete high school was $22,860, which was below the poverty threshold for a family of four in that year. Those with high school diplomas or the equivalent earned median incomes of nearly $30,000 a year for full-time work, while college graduates earned a median of nearly $45,000 a year, or more than twice as much as those who did not complete high school.

Income Distribution Income distribution figures do not reflect the effects of taxes or non- cash government aid such as housing subsidies, healthcare, or food stamps. The food stamp program helps low-income people buy food. Benefits are provided on an electronic card that is accepted at most food stores. Look at Figure 7.19. To compute the numbers in the table, economists take four steps. First, they rank the nation&apos;s households according to income. Then, they divide the list into fifths, or quintiles, with equal numbers of households in each fifth. The lowest fifth, which appears at the top of the list, includes the poorest 20 percent of households. The highest fifth, shown at the bottom of the list, includes the richest 20 percent of households. The first column in Figure 7.19 shows this division into quintiles. Next, they compute each group&apos;s average income by adding up the incomes of all the households in the group and then dividing by the number of households. Finally, they compute each group&apos;s share, or percentage, of total income by dividing the group&apos;s total income by the total income of all the groups. The second column shows each group&apos;s share. The third column shows the cumulative total. (For example, the lowest two fifths of households earned 12 percent of the total income.) Compare the share of the poorest fifth with that of the richest fifth. If you divide richest by poorest, you will see that the richest fifth receives nearly 15 times the income of the poorest fifth. Now look at Figure 7.20. It shows that the numbers for shares of total income, when they are plotted on a graph, form a curve. This graph, called the Lorenz Curve, illustrates the distribution of income in the economy. Let&apos;s see what this Lorenz Curve tells you. First, read the label on each axis. Then look at the straight line running diagonally across the graph. This reference line represents complete equality. Under conditions of complete equality, each quintile would receive one fifth of total income. That means the lowest 20 percent of households would receive 20 percent of total income, as shown by the point (lowest, 20). Similarly, the lowest 40 percent (the first two quintiles) would receive 40 percent of total income, as shown by the point (second, 40), and so on. In 2010, the distribution of income was not equal, as the Lorenz Curve indicates. For example, the point (lowest, 3.3) shows that the lowest 20 percent, or one fifth, of households received just 3.3 percent of the nation&apos;s total income. Percent of Total Income by Quintile, 2010 3.3% 8.5% 14.6% 23.4% 50.2% Lowest fifth Second fifth Third fifth Fourth fifth Highest fifth 3.3% 11.8% 26.4% 49.8% 100% QUINTILE PERCENT OF INCOME FOR QUINTILE CUMULATIVE PERCENT OF INCOME FOR THIS AND LOWER QUINTILES NOTE: Because of rounding, totals may be greater than or less than 100 percent.

Cumulative Distribution of Income(percentage) The point (second, 11.8) shows that the lowest 40 percent, or two fifths, of households received only 11.8 percent of the income. The area on the graph between the line of equality and the Lorenz Curve represents the amount of inequality in income distribution. The larger the area between the curves, the greater the income inequality. Differences in Income As you can see from Figure 7.19 and Figure 7.20, the wealthiest fifth of American households earned more income (50.2 percent) than the bottom four fifths combined. Why are there such differences in income among Americans? Here are some factors. Differences in skills and education Some people are more highly skilled than others, so they earn higher wages. Labor skills are determined by education, training, and a worker&apos;s natural ability. Inheritances Some people inherit large sums of money and earn income by investing it. Others inherit businesses that produce income from profits. Field of work Wages are determined by the demand for labor. Labor demand is a “derived demand” because it is set by demand for what people produce. People who produce goods with a low market value usually earn lower wages. James Webb, a former United States senator from Virginia, commented on the growing income gap: America&apos;s top tier has grown infinitely richer and more removed over the past 25 years . . . . The top 1 percent now takes in an astounding 16 percent of national income, up from 8 percent in 1980. &ndash;James Webb, the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 15, 2006 In fact, in the last two decades, the distribution of income has become less equal. Since 1977, the share of income earned by the lowest three fifths has decreased by 12 percent, while the share earned by the top 1 percent has more than doubled. IdENTIfy Name one program the government uses to help alleviate income inequality. The Economic Goal of Equity The government spends billions of dollars on programs designed to reduce poverty. This money is spent mainly on cash assistance, education, medical benefits, and non-cash benefits such as food stamps and subsidized housing. The stated goal of these programs is not to provide equal distribution of wealth. Rather, it is to ensure a basic standard of 7.6 Poverty and Income Distribution 333 ]]></text>

Low taxes and business-friendly policies encourage businesses to locate in Texas. living for all and to provide the poor an opportunity to improve their condition. Critics of antipoverty programs argue that the programs themselves harm some of the people they are intended to help by encouraging people to remain dependent on government programs. Some analysts say the programs raised unrealistic hopes of eradicating poverty. The costs of the programs have increased as the programs have expanded. Some critics do not object to the antipoverty programs as much as they object to the increase in the size of the government required to administer the programs. The criticisms have led to new policies. These include the Earned Income Tax Credit, the establishment of enterprise zones, job training and other employment assistance, housing assistance, and welfare reform. The Earned Income Tax Credit One of the government&apos;s most successful antipoverty programs is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is a refundable tax credit that low-income families with children receive when they file their federal income tax return. Eligibility is based on the taxpayer&apos;s earned income and the number of qualifying children. In 2010, for example, a married couple with an earned income of $40,363 and two children would receive a maximum credit of $5,036. Established in 1975 to offset the impact of the Social Security payroll tax on low-income families, the EITC has been expanded over the years. A report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that in 2005, the EITC lifted more than four million people above the official poverty line and was “the nation&apos;s most effective antipoverty program for working families.” Enterprise Zones Areas where companies can locate and be free of certain state, local, and federal taxes and restrictions on business operations called enterprise zones, became popular in the 1980s. Zones benefit businesses by lowering their costs. They help local people by making it easier for them to find work. By providing jobs, these zones can help revitalize areas such as inner cities. Job Training In recent decades, federal and state governments have designed job-training programs to help workers who lack the skills to earn an adequate income. In addition, the federal government has made a minimum wage mandatory since 1938. The minimum wage ensures that workers&apos; hourly pay will not fall below a certain point. 334 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Affordable Housing The government also has programs to help poor people obtain affordable housing. In one approach, the government makes payments to landlords who then lower the rent they would otherwise charge. In another program, poor people receive vouchers that cover part of the rent they pay. The third approach is government-owned housing, which charges low rental fees. Welfare to Workfare Poor people often cannot afford basic needs such as food and medical care. The United States has long had a welfare system that provides for those basic needs, especially for children and the elderly. That system underwent major reform when President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. This welfare-reform plan responded to criticisms that welfare encouraged poor people to remain unemployed in order to keep receiving aid. It replaced the traditional antipoverty program for poor families (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC) with a new program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). TANF eliminated cash assistance for poor families. Instead, the federal government provides block grants, or lump sums of money, to the states. The states are now responsible for designing and implementing programs to move most poor adults from welfare dependence to employment. TANF also set a five- year limit on receipt of benefits. The plan calls for a shift from welfare to workfare&ndash;a program requiring work in exchange for temporary assistance from the government. It was hoped that this reform would reduce poverty by providing poor Americans with labor skills and access to a steady, adequate income. Addressing Poverty The federal government has several major types of redistribution programs to help the poor, elderly, and disadvantaged. State and federal governments provide cash transfers, or direct payments of money to poor, disabled, or retired people. The following examples are cash transfer programs: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Launched in 1996, TANF does not provide direct federal welfare payments to the poor. Instead, federal money goes to the states, which design and run their own welfare programs. States must adhere to federal rules that create work incentives and establish a lifetime limit for benefits. TANF aims to move people from depending on welfare to joining the workforce. Social Security The Social Security program was created in 1935, during the Great Depression. At the time, many elderly people lost their life savings and had no income. The program collects payroll taxes from current workers and then redistributes 7.6 Poverty and Income Distribution 335 ]]></text>

Those who receive Social Security include retired people, people unable to work because of a disability, and, in some cases, the widowed spouses or orphaned children of such individuals. Unemployment insurance Unemployment insurance is funded by taxes paid by employers. Compensation checks provide money to workers who have lost their jobs. Recipients must offer proof that they have made efforts to get work. As with TANF, states set the rules for this program. The program is supposed to supply only temporary help. As a result, most states pay benefits to workers for only 26 weeks. In periods of high unemployment, however, the government may decide to pay the benefits longer. Workers&apos; compensationThis program is an insurance program for workers injured or disabled on the job. It is mandated, or required, by state law. Most employers pay workers&apos; compensation insurance to cover future claims by employees. In-Kind Benefits The government also provides poor people with in-kind benefits, goods and services provided for free or at greatly reduced prices. One example is the food stamp program. People who qualify receive a debit card or smart card that they can use to help meet food expenses. Another type of in-kind benefit is subsidized housing. Poor people are allowed to rent housing for less than the regular rent. The government pays the difference to the landlord. Legal aid is legal advice given at no charge. This in-kind benefit covers contracts and other business matters. Poor people charged with a crime may be represented in court by public defenders, who are paid with tax dollars. The right of an accused person to have legal counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Another social service that the U.S. government provides is medical benefits, meaning health insurance for children and people who are elderly, disabled, or poor. Medicare covers Americans over age 65 and disabled people. Medicaid covers some poor people who are unemployed or not covered by their employer&apos;s insurance plans. Administered under the Social Security program, Medicare and Medicaid are enormously expensive programs. A program called the Children&apos;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health insurance for children who are uninsured. CHIP is funded by both state and federal governments. States write the rules for the program within federal guidelines. The program covers more than 6.5 million children. 336 TOPIC 7 Economic Performance and Challenges ]]></text>

Education Programs Federal, state, and local governments all provide educational opportunities to those who need aid. The federal government funds programs from preschool to college. State and local programs aid students with learning disabilities. Education programs add to the nation&apos;s human capital and labor productivity. As explained earlier, improved education and technology can make an entire economy more productive. RECALL Who pays for the Children&apos;s Health Insurance Program? Charitable Donations In addition to providing direct assistance to the needy, federal and state governments also encourage private action to help people in need. Federal tax law allows both individuals and corporations to take tax deductions for charitable donations. This policy provides an economic incentive to give money and property to relief organizations, as well as to other nonprofit groups such as churches, hospitals, colleges, libraries, or museums. In 2012, American individuals and organizations gave more than $316 billion in tax-deductible charitable contributions. There are opportunity costs associated with donating to charity. Money given away cannot be spent or invested in other productive ways. In addition, governments lose vital tax revenues by allowing deductions for charitable giving. Still, governments encourage it. As one tax expert noted: It&apos;s always better to give than receive. The glory of charitable donations is that you give and receive at the same time. &ndash;Jeff Schnepper, “Give and Grow Rich With Charitable Deductions” The government may also provide grants and other assistance to organizations that provide social services. A grant is a financial award given by a government agency to a private individual or group in order to carry out a specific task. Many people believe that private groups do a more effective job of helping people than the government can. In 2001, President George W. Bush announced a new initiative that allowed religious organizations to receive federal funding support for programs to alleviate poverty. The President believed that these groups provided a special compassion that made their programs particularly successful. Bush established an Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships to help religious groups work more effectively with the federal government. 7.6 Poverty and Income Distribution 337 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="406"> <text><![CDATA[ LESSON SUMMARIES Use these lesson summaries, and the longer versions available online, to review the key ideas for each lesson in this topic. Lesson 1: Gross Domestic Product LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of all final goods and services produced in a country or region in a given year. It measures an economy&apos;s size. When GDP is corrected for inflation, it is called real GDP. GDP ignores nonmarket and informal activities, externalities, and quality of life. GDP depends on the interaction of aggregate supply&ndash;supply throughout the economy&ndash; and aggregate demand&ndash;demand for all products in the economy. It rises and falls with these variables. Lesson 2: Business Cycles LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.12 A business cycle is a period of economic expansion, or growth, followed by a period of contraction. Stages of the cycle depend on the rate of business investment, interest rates, consumer expectations, and the effects of external shocks. It is difficult to forecast business cycles accurately. The United States has passed through a series of contractions&ndash;such as the Great Depression or the recession of 2008&ndash;and expansions&ndash;such as the 1990s boom or the expansion after 2009. Lesson 3: Economic Growth SS.912.E.2.5, SS.912.E.3.2 GDP is a measure of economic growth, but because it also reflects population growth, economists use GDP per capita (or per person) as a measure of prosperity. Increased capital investment per worker boosts productivity and prosperity. Savings and investment help build the capital stock. Government action and trade can also affect prosperity. Technological progress can improve the productivity of capital and thereby boost prosperity. Lesson 4: Unemployment SS.912.E.1.10, SS.912.E.1.12 Unemployment can result from people being between jobs, not having skills needed by employers, seasonal lulls in an industry, or contractions in a business cycle. Full employment is the level reached at the peak of the business cycle, though some workers may still be unemployed due to job changes, lack of skill, or the season. Even with full employment, there may be people who are underemployed or who have given up looking for work. Lesson 5: Inflation and Deflation SS.912.E.2.7, SS.912.E.3.1 Inflation is a general increase in prices across an economy. Price indexes measure inflation. Inflation may be caused by increases in the money supply, decreases in aggregate supply, or increases in aggregate demand. Inflation reduces people&apos;s purchasing power if their incomes do not keep pace. Inflation also reduces the real value of interest rates. Deflation is a sustained drop in price levels. The recession of 2008 caused fears of deflation, which can discourage economic growth. Lesson 6: Poverty and Income Distribution SS.912.E.1.9 The government defines poverty as an income too low to satisfy minimum needs. The poverty rate is the percentage of households below that income. Poverty tends to occur in families with a single income, in areas with few good jobs, or as a result of discrimination or a lack of education. Incomes vary greatly among households in the United States. To relieve poverty, the government and charitable contributions fund antipoverty programs. ]]></text>

People disagree on whether helping the poor should be the job of government or private organizations. DOCUMENT A Before becoming President, Barack Obama expressed his opinion about the role of government in helping the poor. What&apos;s most overwhelming about urban poverty is that it&apos;s so difficult to escape–it&apos;s isolating and it&apos;s everywhere…. When you&apos;re in these neighborhoods, you can see what a difference it makes to have a government that cares. You can see what a free lunch program does for a hungry child. You can see what a little extra money from an earned income tax credit does for a family that&apos;s struggling. You can see what prenatal care does for the health of a mother and a newborn. So don&apos;t tell me there&apos;s no role for government in lifting up our cities. &ndash;Senator Barack Obama, speech, July 18, 2007 DOCUMENT B Ron Paul, a long-time member of Congress, strongly believed that the federal government had grown too big and powerful. Voluntary charities and organizations, such as friendly societies that devoted themselves to helping those in need, flourished in the days before the welfare state turned charity into a government function…. Releasing the charitable impulses of the American people by freeing them from the excessive tax burden so they can devote more of their resources to charity, is a moral and constitutional means of helping the needy. By contrast, the federal welfare state is neither moral nor constitutional. Nowhere in the Constitution is the federal government given the power to levy excessive taxes on one group of citizens for the benefit of another group of citizens. &ndash;Representative Ron Paul in the U.S. House of Representatives, February 13, 2003 DOCUMENT C Food stamps are a major form of government aid to the poor.

But what is fair to one person may not be fair to another. For example, some would argue that fairness requires that all people be taxed at the same rate. Others say that the person who earns more money should pay a higher percentage of income in taxes. In fact, this concept, known as progressive taxation, has been at the base of our income tax system since its beginnings. (You will read more about progressive taxation and the concept of equity shortly.) The Impact of Taxation Looking at all of the taxes taken from your paycheck can be discouraging. You worked hard for that money, and now it is being taken away. Similar feelings of frustration over taxes helped persuade American colonists to declare their independence from Britain.

    <page pageNumber="415"> <text><![CDATA[ the Constitution and our elected representatives in Congress, to raise money in the form of taxes. In fact, taxation is the primary way that the government collects money. Taxes give the government the money it needs to operate. The income received by a government from taxes and other nontax sources is called revenue. Without revenue from taxes, the government would not be able to provide the goods and services that we not only benefit from, but also expect the government to provide. For example, we authorize the government to spend well over $3.5 trillion a year. This money helps provide national defense, highways, education, and law enforcement. We also ask the government to provide help to people in need. All of these goods and services cost money&ndash; in workers&apos; salaries, in materials, in land and labor. All members of our society share these costs through the payment of taxes. The national taxes we pay and the spending they help make possible have a large macroeconomic impact. Total government spending in the United States was over 32 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal year 2013. Federal outlays alone topped 20 percent of GDP. The way these huge sums are collected and then spent can have a number of effects on economic growth&ndash;helping to spur it in some cases and dampening it in others. The Power to Tax Taxation is a powerful tool. The founders of the United States thought long and hard before giving this tool to their new national government. The Constitution they created assigned each branch of the government certain powers and responsibilities. The powers of the legislative branch&ndash;Congress&ndash;appear in Article I, Section 8. The very first clause in this section grants Congress the power to tax. This clause is the basis for all federal tax laws. Limits on the Power to Tax The Constitution also spells out specific limits on the government&apos;s power to tax. Two of those limits are in the taxation clause. First, the purpose of a tax must be “to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.” A tax cannot bring in money that goes to individual interests. Second, federal taxes must be the same in every state. The federal gas tax, for example, cannot be 4 cents per gallon in Maryland and 10 cents per gallon in South Dakota. Other provisions of the Constitution also limit the kinds of taxes Congress can levy, or impose. For example, Congress cannot tax religious services, because that would violate the freedom of religion promised by the First Amendment. The Twenty- Fourth Amendment prohibits “poll taxes,” or tax payments required in order to vote. Another clause of the Constitution prohibits taxing exports&ndash;goods sent out of the United States to foreign customers. The government can collect taxes only on imports&ndash;goods brought into the United States. (Congress can restrict or prohibit the export of certain goods, however, such as technology or weapons.) Yet another clause of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4) prohibits Congress from levying a capitation, or “head,” tax, which is a tax to be paid by every single person. This same clause also prohibited direct taxes unless they were divided among the states according to population. A direct tax is one paid directly by a taxpayer to the government rather than indirectly&ndash;say, to a shopkeeper who later sends the money to the government. But, the Sixteenth Amendment legalized a direct tax on citizens&apos; personal income. This income-tax amendment was ratified in 1913. IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS According to the Constitution, for what purpose can government collect taxes? Tax Structures and Tax Bases Despite the constitutional limits on its power, the government actually collects a wide variety of taxes.

Second, they describe a tax according to the object taxed&ndash; the tax base. Progressive Taxes A progressive tax is a tax for which the percentage of income paid in taxes increases as income increases. People with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. People with very small incomes might pay no tax at all. In the United States, the federal income tax is structured this way. Figure 8.1 illustrates a progressive tax system. Notice that the tax rate in this example rises from 15 to 25 and then to 30 percent for that portion of income above certain levels. This is a progressive tax rate structure because as income rises, the percentage of income paid in taxes also rises. Proportional Taxes A proportional tax is a tax for which the percentage of income paid in taxes remains the same at all income levels. Selena Diaz, a corporate executive, earns $350,000 per year. Tony Owens, a nurse, earns $50,000 per year. If government levied a 6 percent proportional tax on both their incomes, Selena would pay 6 percent of $350,000, or $21,000, in taxes. Tony would pay 6 percent of $50,000, or $3,000, in taxes. With a proportional income tax, whether income goes up or down, the percentage of income paid in taxes stays the same. Regressive Taxes A regressive tax is a tax for which the percentage of income paid in taxes decreases as income increases. The sales tax levied on the sale of goods and services in many states is generally regressive&ndash;even though the sales tax rate remains constant. This is because higher-income households typically spend a lower proportion of their incomes on the goods and services that are taxable under a sales tax. As a result, although wealthier people may pay more actual dollars in sales taxes, the proportion of their incomes spent on sales taxes is lower than that of lower-income households. Selena Diaz, for example, may pay $8,000 in sales taxes while Tony Owens pays $3,500. But Tony is paying 7 percent of his income in sales taxes while Selena is paying only about 2 percent. Tax Bases A tax base is the income, property, good, or service that is subject to a tax. Different taxes have different bases. The individual income tax is based on a person&apos;s earnings.

Analyze Graphs Do you think consumers or businesses will pay the larger share of the tax? Explain. income tax uses a company&apos;s profits as its base. The property tax is based on real estate and other property. The tax base for the sales tax is goods or services that are sold. When government policymakers create a new tax, they first decide what the base will be for the tax: income, profits, property, sales, or some other category. RECALL Is the federal individual income tax proportional, progressive, or regressive? The Tax Burden Government tax policies have a real impact on millions of individuals and businesses. These impacts can affect the entire economy. Thus, it is important to think about who actually bears the burden of a tax. This is not necessarily the person who sends in the money to pay the tax bill. How can we know who is actually bearing the burden of a tax? The answer lies in supply-and-demand analysis. For the purpose of this analysis, consider this example: Suppose the government imposes a gasoline tax of $.50 per gallon and collects the tax from service stations. You may think the burden of the tax falls only on the service stations, because they send the tax money to the government. But you will see that this is not always the case. Figure 8.2 shows the original supply curve (in green) and a supply curve after the $.50 tax is imposed (in blue). You see that before the tax, the market was at equilibrium, and gas cost $1.00 per gallon. The new supply curve reflects the fact that when a tax is imposed on a good, the cost of supplying the good increases. Quantity supplied will decrease at every price level. Notice the steep demand curve in Figure 8.2. This is what you would see if demand for gas were inelastic&ndash;that is, if consumers bought about the same amount no matter what the price. So, when demand is inelastic, the tax will increase the price of each gallon by a relatively large amount, and consumers will bear a large share of the tax. The $.50 tax will increase the equilibrium price by $.40 (from $1.00 to $1.40). In other words, consumers will pay about four fifths of the tax. In contrast, if demand is relatively elastic, the demand curve will be relatively flat, as in Figure 8.3. Consumers will pay a relatively small part of the tax. In this case, a $.50 tax increases the equilibrium price by only $.10 (from $1.00 to $1.10). Consumers pay only one fifth of the tax. Businesses pay the other four fifths. This example shows the incidence of a tax&ndash; that is, the final burden of a tax. When policymakers consider a new tax, they examine who will actually 8.1 Understanding Taxes 351 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="418"> <text><![CDATA[ bear the burden. As in the example above, producers can “pass on” a portion of the burden to consumers. Generally, the more inelastic the demand, the more easily the seller can shift the tax to consumers. The more elastic the demand, the more the seller bears the burden. RECALL Who bears the greater burden of a tax on a good or service when demand is inelastic? Key Characteristics of a Tax Although it is sometimes difficult to decide whether a specific tax is proportional, progressive, or regressive, economists do generally agree on the qualities a tax ought to have. A tax should have four characteristics: simplicity; efficiency; certainty; and equity, or fairness. Simplicity. Tax laws should be simple and easily understood. Taxpayers and businesses should be able to keep the necessary records and pay the taxes on a predictable schedule. Efficiency. Government administrators should be able to assess and collect taxes without spending too much time or money. Similarly, taxpayers should be able to pay taxes without giving up too much time or paying too much money in fees. Certainty. Certainty is also a characteristic of a good tax. It should be clear to the taxpayer when a tax is due, how much money is due, and how the tax should be paid. Equity. The tax system should be fair, so that no one bears too much or too little of the tax burden. Determining Equity Although everyone agrees that a tax system should be equitable and fair to taxpayers, people often disagree on what equity really means. Does it require equal distribution of wealth, or does it simply demand equal opportunity and treatment for all? Over time, this debate has led economists to propose two different ideas about how to measure the fairness of a tax. The first idea is called the benefits-received principle. According to this principle, a person should pay taxes based on the level of benefits he or she expects to receive from the government. People who drive, for example, pay gasoline taxes that are used to build and maintain highways. In this way, the people who receive the most benefit from the roads contribute the most to their upkeep. The second idea about fairness is called the ability-to-pay principle. According to this principle, people should pay taxes according to their ability Who Bears the Tax Burden: Elastic Demand OriginalsupplyPrice Lower quantity Higher quantity $1.10 $1.00 Quantity Demand New supply with$.50 tax >> Figure 8.3 Here we see the impact of a tax when demand for the taxed good is elastic.

Achieving equity in a tax system for a nation the size of the U.S. is a huge challenge. Many complain about the number and complexity of taxes we are subject to. Some of this complexity is the result of efforts to achieve equity. Balancing Tax Revenues and Tax Rates How much revenue does a good tax generate? The answer is “enough, but not too much.” That is, enough so that citizens&apos; needs are met, but not so much that the tax discourages production. For example, if a company has to pay $100,000 in taxes, it will not be able to use that $100,000 to expand production. If tax rates are lower, however, the company can use more of its income to stimulate production rather than to pay taxes. Ultimately, many people argue, the economy benefits from lower tax rates. The debate over the appropriate level of taxation is a vigorous one. In this country&ndash;and around the world&ndash;people have widely different views on this subject.

The federal government also receives revenue from corporate income taxes, social insurance taxes, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, and taxes on imports. Individual Income Taxes The government&apos;s main source of revenues is the federal tax on individuals&apos; taxable income. This is a direct tax, or a tax collected directly from the person or entity that pays it. As Figure 8.4 shows, 46 percent of the federal government&apos;s receipts for 2014 were expected to come from the payment of individual income taxes. The graph shows the other sources of government receipts, as well. It is important to note that today, the receipts shown in Figure 8.4 rarely cover the full cost of government. In recent decades, the federal government has borrowed huge sums of money virtually every year to cover budget deficits. The amount of federal income tax a person owes is determined on an annual basis. In theory, the federal government could wait until the end of the tax year to collect individual income taxes.

    <page pageNumber="421"> <text><![CDATA[ reality, that would be a problem for both taxpayers and the government. Like other employers, the government has to pay regularly for rent, supplies, services, and employees&apos; salaries. A single annual payment from all the nation&apos;s taxpayers at once would make meeting these expenses difficult. Similarly, many people might have trouble paying their taxes in one large sum. For these reasons, federal income tax is collected in a “pay-as-you-earn” system. This means that individuals usually pay most of their income tax throughout the calendar year as they earn income. They have until mid-April of the following year to pay any additional income taxes they owe. Individual Tax Brackets The federal income tax is a progressive tax, which is aimed at the economic goal of equity. In other words, the tax rate rises with the amount of taxable income. You can see this progressive structure in Figure 8.5. This table gives the rates for an unmarried filer who is not the head of a household. Married couples who file their taxes jointly have a different set of tax rates. The schedule you see here shows seven rates. Each applies to a different range of income, or tax bracket. For example, a person subject to this tax table and with a taxable income of $8,925 or less Federal Receipts, 2014 (Estimated) would pay 10 percent income tax. If that person earned more than $400,000 in taxable income, he or she would pay the highest rate&ndash;39.6 percent&ndash; on earnings in excess of that amount. (The person would pay lower rates on the income below $400,000.) Each year, the IRS publishes new tax rate schedules that reflect any changes in the federal tax code. Supporters of our progressive system argue that it helps promote the economic goal of equity. Others, however, say progressive rates reduce the incentive to work hard and earn more. Our progressive tax system may add cost in the form of complexity. One recent study claimed Americans spend $140 and 7.6 billion hours annually on their federal taxes alone. Not all of this time and money is a result of the progressive tax code, but some of it is. Tax Withholding Employers are responsible in part for carrying out the system of collecting federal income taxes. They do so by withholding, or taking payments out of your pay before you receive it. The amount they withhold is based on an estimate of how much you will owe in federal income taxes for the entire year. After withholding the money, the employer forwards it to the federal government as an “installment payment” on your upcoming annual income tax bill. 3% 6%46% 11% 34% SOURCE: Office of Management and Budget Individual income taxes Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and other retirement receipts Corporate income taxes Excise Taxes Customs, estate, gift, and other taxes >> Figure 8.4 Analyze Graphs Based on this graph, what effect would an economic downturn, with lower corporate and individual earnings, have on government receipts?

    <page pageNumber="422"> <text><![CDATA[ Filing a Tax Return After the calendar year ends, employers give their employees a report stating how much income tax has already been withheld and sent to the government. The employee uses that information to complete a tax return. A tax return is a form used to file income taxes. On it, you declare your income to the government and figure out how much of that income is taxable. Taxable income is a person&apos;s gross (or total) income minus exemptions and deductions. Gross income includes earned income&ndash;salaries, wages, tips, and commissions. It also includes income from investments such as interest on savings accounts and dividends from stock. Personal exemptions are set amounts that you subtract from your gross income for yourself, your spouse, and any dependents. Tax deductions are amounts that you can subtract, or deduct, from your gross income. Commonly taken deductions include mortgage interest, large medical expenses, and state and local tax payments. Taxpayers may also deduct charitable donations. By creating a tax benefit for charitable giving, the government creates a positive incentive and lowers the cost of giving money away. The government created this incentive because, while charitable giving costs donors money they could use for other purposes, it also provides great benefits to the Federal Income Tax Rates, 2013 organizations that receive the money, the people those organizations serve, and society at large. Once you determine how much tax you owe, you can apply available tax credits. A tax credit is an amount that you can subtract from the total amount of your income tax. You can claim a credit for such things as a portion of the cost of child care and higher education. Completing a tax return allows you to determine whether the amount of income taxes you have already paid is higher or lower than the actual amount owed. If you have paid more than you owe, the government sends you a refund. If you have paid less than you owe, you must pay the balance. All federal income tax returns must be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, by midnight on April 15 (or the next business day if April 15 falls on a weekend or holiday). Corporate Income Taxes Like individuals, corporations must pay federal income tax on their taxable income. Recall, Figure 8.4 showed that corporate taxes were expected to account for 11 percent of federal receipts in 2014. Determining corporate taxable income can be a challenge, because businesses can take many deductions. That is, they can subtract many expenses from their income before they reach the amount of income that is subject to taxation.

FICA taxes fund two large government social- insurance programs, Social Security and Medicare. Employees and employers share FICA payments. Social Security Taxes Most of the FICA taxes you pay go to the Social Security Administration to fund Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), or Social Security. Social Security was established in 1935 to ease the hardships of the Great Depression. From the start, Social Security provided old-age pensions and unemployment insurance to workers. Today, it also provides benefits to surviving family members of wage earners and to people whose disabilities keep them from working. Each year the government establishes an income cap for Social Security taxes. In 2013, the cap was $113,700. No Social Security taxes could be withheld from a taxpayer&apos;s wages and salaries above that amount. Medicare Taxes FICA taxes also fund Medicare. The Medicare program is a national health insurance program that helps pay for healthcare for people over age 65. It also covers people with certain disabilities. Both employees and self-employed people pay the Medicare tax on all their earnings. There is no ceiling as there is for Social Security payments. In spite of this fact, Medicare is experiencing a growing gap between receipts in tax payments and expenditures. You will learn more about this shortly. Unemployment Taxes The federal government also collects an unemployment tax, which is paid by employers. In effect, the tax pays for an insurance policy for workers. 8.2 Federal Taxes 357 ]]></text>

In order to collect unemployment benefits, an unemployed person usually must show that he or she is actively looking for another job. The unemployment program is financed by both state and federal unemployment taxes. CATEgORIzE Who benefits from Medicare taxes? Other National Taxes What are the taxes on gasoline and cable television service called? If you inherit money from your great aunt, will you have to pay a tax? Why are some imported products so expensive? To answer these questions, you need to look at excise, estate, gift, and import taxes. Excise Taxes An excise tax is a general revenue tax on the sale or manufacture of a good. Federal excise taxes apply to gasoline, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, telephone services, cable television, and other items. An excise tax is an example of an indirect tax, or a tax that is collected by a person or business other than the one who pays it. In this case, businesses collect the tax and consumers pay it. >> Analyze Political Cartoons How would you summarize this cartoon&apos;s view of the estate tax? Bounce to Activate Gallery Estate Taxes An estate tax is a tax on the estate, or total value of the money and property, of a person who has died. It is paid out of the person&apos;s estate before the heirs receive their share. A person&apos;s estate includes not only money, but also real estate, cars, furniture, investments, jewelry, paintings, and insurance. As of 2013, if the total value of an estate was $5,250,000 or less, there was no federal estate tax. Because an estate tax is a progressive tax, the rate rises with increasing value. That is, a larger estate will be taxed by the federal government at a higher rate than a smaller one. Gift Taxes The gift tax is a tax on the money or property that one living person gives to another. The goal of the gift tax, established in 1924, was to keep people from avoiding estate taxes by giving away their money before they died. Under current law, a person can give up to $14,000 a year tax-free to each of several different people. Tariffs&ndash;Taxes on Imported Goods Taxes on imported goods (foreign goods brought into the country) are called tariffs. Tariffs were once the most important source of federal revenue, but that is no longer the case. Today they represent a tiny share of federal revenues. Today, most tariffs are intended to protect American farmers and industries from foreign competitors rather than to generate revenue. Tariffs raise the prices of foreign items, which helps keep the prices of American products competitive. Taxes That Affect Behavior The basic goal of taxation is to create revenue. However, governments sometimes use tax policy to discourage the public from buying harmful products. They also use taxes to encourage constructive behavior. The use of taxation to discourage or encourage behavior is called a tax incentive. One example you learned about earlier is the available tax deduction for charitable giving. Federal taxes on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages are examples of so-called sin taxes. Their main purpose is to discourage people from buying and using these products. Incentives also come in the form of tax credits. Congress tries to encourage energy conservation by offering a variety of credits to consumers and industry. People may receive tax credits for purchasing fuel-efficient electric or hybrid vehicles or for improvements that make buildings more energy efficient.

As you will read, government spending meets numerous needs. Our elected leaders have decided that much of the money should provide for our health and welfare. In reality, when the government considers the huge sum of money it collects to fund the budget, most of it is already accounted for. After the government fulfills all its legal obligations, only about a third of the money remains to be spent. Figure 8.6 shows the major categories of federal spending in the 2012 budget year. Some of these categories, such as Social Security and Medicare, are mandatory. Mandatory spending refers to money that Congress is mandated, or required, by existing law to spend on certain programs or to use for interest payments on the national debt. Other categories, such as defense and education, are discretionary. Discretionary spending is spending about which lawmakers are free to make choices.

ExPRESS IdEAS CLEARLy Explain why government does not truly get to decide how to spend all the money in its budget. Government Entitlements Except for interest on the national debt, most of the mandatory spending items in the federal budget are for entitlement programs. Entitlements are social welfare programs that people are “entitled to” and benefit from if they meet certain eligibility requirements, such as being at a particular income level or age. The federal government guarantees assistance for all those who qualify. As the number of people who qualify rises, mandatory spending rises as well. As a result, managing the cost of entitlement programs has become a major concern. Some, but not all, entitlements are “meanstested.” In other words, people with higher incomes may receive lower benefits or no benefits at all. Medicaid, for instance, is means-tested. Social Security is not. A retired person who has worked and paid Social Security taxes is entitled to certain benefits. Similarly, military veterans and retired Federal Spending, 2012 federal employees are entitled to receive pensions from the government. Entitlements are a largely unchanging part of government spending. Once Congress has set the requirements, it cannot control how many people become eligible for each kind of benefit. Congress can change the eligibility requirements or reduce the amount of the benefit in order to try to keep costs down. Such actions, however, require a change in the law. Social Security Social Security makes up a huge portion of all federal spending. About 58 million Americans receive monthly benefits from the Social Security Administration. Of those beneficiaries, some are disabled workers, but the great majority are retired workers. Many of those retirees rely solely on their Social Security checks to support themselves. The Social Security system faces an uncertain future today. To understand the uncertainty, you must understand how the Social Security system is set up. American workers pay into the system through taxes. Those taxes go toward benefits for people who are no longer working. That is, the money that you pay into Social Security today does not go into a fund for your own future retirement. It goes toward supporting people who have already retired.

A key reason for this is the so-called baby boom&ndash;the generation born following World War II. This large demographic group has been the backbone of the workforce. But they did not have children at anywhere near the rate of their parents, and the oldest baby boomers are entering retirement. Millions more will soon follow. As this happens, the ratio of existing workers to retirees will fall. The system may not reach crisis levels for some time. But unless something is done, today&apos;s high school students might receive only limited benefits from Social Security when they retire. At the same time, making changes to the program is politically difficult. Proposals for doing so typically meet significant opposition. Medicare Medicare serves about 47 million people, most of them over 65 years old. The program pays for hospital care and for the costs of physicians and medical services. It also pays healthcare bills for people who suffer from certain disabilities and diseases. Like Social Security, Medicare is funded by taxes withheld from people&apos;s paychecks. Monthly payments paid by people who make certain levels of taxable income and receive Medicare benefits also help pay for the program. Medicare costs have been growing rapidly, partly as a result of expensive technology, but also because people are living longer. The basic problem facing Medicare is the same as the one facing Social Security: a falling ratio of workers to beneficiaries. Medicaid Medicaid benefits low-income families, some people with disabilities, and elderly people in nursing homes. It is the largest source of funds for medical and health-related services for America&apos;s poorest people. The federal government shares the costs of Medicaid with state governments. Other Mandatory Spending Programs Other means-tested entitlements benefit people and families whose incomes fall below a certain level. Requirements vary from program to program. Federal programs include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the National School Lunch Program. The federal government also pays retirement benefits and insurance for federal workers, as well as veterans&apos; pensions and unemployment insurance.

One reason is that healthcare costs have increased at more than twice the rate of inflation over the last few decades. The average expenditure for healthcare rose from $891 per person in 1960 to $8,680 in 2011. To keep pace, health insurance costs have skyrocketed. As a result, some 48 million Americans had no health insurance in 2011. Over the years, leaders have proposed a range of solutions to these issues&ndash;from single-payer systems organized by the government, to expansion of healthcare tax credits to help make insurance more affordable. Others have insisted we rely on market forces to correct problems. In 2010, President Obama signed a new law called the Affordable Care Act. This law requires Americans who lack certain health insurance coverage to purchase it through competitive private exchanges in their state or through a federal insurance marketplace. The program also seeks to expand the Medicaid program and offers subsidies to help lower-income people afford health insurance. It remains to be seen how this program will affect healthcare costs or access for previously uninsured Americans. dESCRIbE What key demographic challenge faces the largest entitlement programs in the United States? Spending on Discretionary Programs As you have read, the majority of the federal budget is devoted to mandatory spending. The remaining funds available for discretionary spending are divided among a wide variety of programs. Defense Spending Of the categories of discretionary spending, defense spending is the largest. (See Figure 8.7.) Defense spending has dropped somewhat since the end of the Cold War in the late 1900s as a percentage of the total federal budget. As you can see from the graph, defense spending consumes about 19 percent of the federal budget. However, you can also see that defense accounts for more than half of discretionary spending. The Department of Defense spends most of the defense budget. It pays the salaries of all the men and women in the army, navy, air force, and marines, as well as the department&apos;s civilian employees. Defense spending, of course, also buys weapons, missiles, battleships, tanks, airplanes, and other equipment. Other Discretionary Spending Look again at Figure 8.7.

This part of the federal budget also pays the salaries of the millions of people who work for the civilian branches of the federal government. They include park rangers, FBI agents, file clerks, senators and members of Congress, geologists, CIA agents, Cabinet secretaries, meat inspectors, and many others. Federal Aid to State and Local Governments Some federal tax money finds its way to state and local governments&ndash;much of it from the discretionary portion of the federal budget. In 2011, about $625 billion in federal grants went to the states. This is an average of about $2,000 per person and represents nearly 40 percent of state and local expenditures. As you have read, state and federal governments share the cost of some entitlement programs, including Medicaid and unemployment compensation. They also share funding in other social programs. Additional federal money goes to the states for education, lower-income housing, highway construction, mass transit, healthcare, employment training, and dozens of other programs. Federal grants-in-aid are grants of federal money for certain closely defined purposes. States must use these federal funds only for the purpose specified and obey the federal guidelines for which aid is given. State and local governments rely on federal aid for a variety of needs. But nothing reveals that reliance as vividly as a disaster. For example, after Hurricane Katrina slammed into coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama in 2005, those states did not have the resources to deal with the widespread destruction and human misery that the storm left behind. They looked to the federal government for help. Although critics denounced the federal relief agencies for their slow response, Congress appropriated $116 billion to help the states recover from the disaster. A similar scenario occurred in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage in New York and New Jersey. Again, Congress pledged some $50 billion to aid in recovery. dESCRIbE Describe the key features of the discretionary portion of the federal budget. ASSESSMENT 1.

In this Lesson, you will examine these priorities. For example, you will see that funding education is a priority for state and local legislators. Although school-related tax increases can be painful to the taxpayer, the programs they fund help ensure that students receive a quality education. Operating Budgets Like families and individuals, governments must plan their spending ahead of time. That planning involves drawing up a budget. A budget is an estimate of future revenues and expenses. The federal government has just one budget for planned revenue and expenses. States, however, have two budgets: operating budgets and capital budgets. A state puts together an operating budget to plan for its dayto- day spending needs. Those expenses include salaries of state employees and supplies needed to run the government, such as computers and paper. They also include the maintenance of state facilities such as recreation areas and parks. VIDEO ETEXT WRITING ASSESSMENT Go ONLINE for digital resources AUDIO ACTIVITYSavvas.com/FloridaSS ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="432"> <text><![CDATA[ Capital Budgets A state also draws up a capital budget to pay for major capital, or investment, spending. If the state builds a new bridge, the money likely comes from this budget. Most of these expenses are met by long-term borrowing or the sale of bonds. The planning process for projects covered by the capital budget may begin years before the project itself begins. Balancing State Budgets In most states, the governor prepares the budget with the help of a budget agency. The legislature then discusses and eventually approves the budget. Unlike the federal government, 48 states require balanced budgets&ndash; budgets in which revenues are equal to spending. These laws, however, apply only to the operating budget, not the capital budget. That makes it easier to balance the overall state budget than to balance the federal budget. ChECK UNdERSTANdINg Would the construction of a new courthouse come out of a state&apos;s operating budget or capital budget? Explain. State Spending Categories Spending policies differ among the 50 states. You are probably most familiar with state spending on education, highways, police protection, and state recreation areas. There are many other categories of state spending, as you will read. Education Every state spends taxpayer money to support at least one public state university. Some, such as Texas and California, have large systems with many campuses throughout the state. In many states, tax dollars also support agricultural and technical colleges, teachers colleges, and two-year community colleges. Spending on higher education is especially important to maintaining economic growth. Public colleges and universities offer an education at much lower tuition than most private institutions. Lower tuition enables large numbers of people to get the training and skills they need to contribute to the economy. State governments also provide financial help to their local governments, which run public elementary, middle, and high schools. The total amount of money spent per student varies among the states. The national average was $10,560 per student per year in 2011. Spending on education is the most significant expenditure in state budgets. Figure 8.8 shows that it represents about 30 percent of state spending nationwide. Public Safety State police are a familiar sight along the nation&apos;s highways. The state police enforce traffic laws and help motorists in emergencies.

These institutions house people convicted of state crimes. Transportation Building and maintaining highway systems is another major state expense. State crews resurface roads and repair bridges. Some money for roads comes from the federal government. In turn, states contribute money to federal and interstate highway systems. States pay at least some of the costs of other kinds of transportation facilities, such as waterways and airports. Money for such projects may also comes from federal and local government budgets. Health and Welfare States look after the health and welfare of the public in various ways. Their public health policies promote health and prevent the spread of diseases. State funds support some public hospitals and clinics. State government regulations promote health and prevent disease by protecting water supplies against pollution. As you have read, states also help pay for many of the federal programs that assist individuals, such as unemployment compensation benefits. During a recession, these benefits can help boost the economy. Arts and Recreation If you&apos;ve hiked in a state forest or picnicked in a state park, you&apos;ve enjoyed another benefit of state tax dollars. Nature reserves and parks preserve scenic and historic places for people to visit and enjoy. States also run museums and help fund music and art programs. Administration Besides providing services, state governments need to spend money just to keep running. Like the federal government, state governments have an executive branch (the governor&apos;s office), a legislative branch, and a court system. State tax revenues pay the salaries of all these and other state workers, including judges, maintenance crews in state parks, the governor, and professors in state universities. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS Explain how state universities contribute to economic growth. Revenue for State Budgets For every dollar a state spends, it must take in a dollar in revenue. Otherwise, it cannot maintain a balanced budget. The 50 states took in almost $2.3 trillion from various sources in 2011. Where does this money come from?

But as you can see, taxes of various sorts make up an important share of state revenues. Just as the United States Constitution limits the federal government&apos;s power to tax, it also puts limits on the states. Because trade and commerce are considered national enterprises, states cannot tax imports or exports. They also cannot tax goods sent between states. Nonprofit organizations, including religious groups and charities, are usually tax exempt; that is, they are not subject to taxes. Sales and Excise Taxes Figure 8.9 shows that sales taxes are a main source of revenue, and the largest tax in terms of revenue, for state governments. A sales tax is a tax on goods and services. The tax&ndash;a percentage of the purchase price&ndash;is added on at the cash register and paid by the purchaser. All but a few of the 50 states collect sales taxes. Their sales tax rates range from 2.9 to 7.5 percent. Some local governments have their own, additional sales tax. In every state, some categories of products are exempt from sales tax. For example, many states do not charge sales tax on basic needs such as food and clothing. Exemption of everyday items that most people buy in similar quantities helps make sales taxes less regressive. State Revenue, 2011 Even states without a sales tax impose excise taxes that apply to specific products and activities. Some are sin taxes&ndash;taxes that are intended to discourage harmful behavior&ndash;on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco. Other taxes apply to hotel and motel rooms, automobiles, rental cars, and insurance policies. Many states also tax gasoline. This state gasoline tax is in addition to the federal tax. Individual Income Tax Individual income taxes are another large contributor to many states&apos; budgets. People pay this state income tax in addition to the federal income tax. Figure 8.9 shows that state individual income taxes contribute over 11 percent of state revenue. As such, they have a substantial impact on the economy of the state. Some states tax incomes at a flat rate&ndash;that is, as a proportional tax, with the same rate applied to all income levels. Others use a progressive tax, either by creating their own progressive rate structure or by charging taxpayers a given percentage of their federal income tax. A handful of states have no state income tax. A couple tax only interest and dividends from investments, not wages and salaries. Corporate Income Tax Most states collect income taxes from corporations that do business in the state. Some states levy taxes on business profits at a fixed, flat rate. A few charge progressive rates&ndash;higher tax rates for businesses with higher profits.

As you have seen in Figure 8.9, corporate income taxes make up only a small portion of state revenues&ndash;about 2 percent. Nevertheless, the level of corporate income taxes can exert a strong influence on a state&apos;s economy. Low corporate taxes, along with a well-educated workforce and efficient public services, can make it easier to attract entrepreneurs and new businesses to a state. Politicians keep this fact in mind when they determine their state&apos;s taxing policies. Other State Taxes Besides the corporate income tax, businesses pay a variety of other state taxes and fees. Do you want to be a hairdresser, a carpenter, or a building contractor? If so, you will have to pay a licensing fee. A licensing fee is a kind of tax that people pay to carry on different kinds of business within a state. Some states charge a transfer tax when documents such as stock certificates are transferred and recorded. Other states tax the value of the stock shares that corporations issue. As you read earlier, the federal government taxes the estate of a person who has died. Some states, in turn, charge an inheritance tax on the value of the property that goes to each heir. Some states also tax property. That includes real estate, or real property&ndash;land and any permanent structures on the land to which a person has legal title. It also includes personal property&ndash;movable possessions or assets&ndash;such as jewelry, furniture, and boats. Some states even tax property that is intangible (meaning “not able to be touched”), such as bank accounts, stocks, and bonds. Today, however, most property taxes, especially on real estate, are levied by local governments. RECALL What kind of tax raises the price of cigarettes and no other goods or services? Local Government Spending and Revenue Your local government plays a part in many aspects of everyday life, including your town&apos;s public schools. Like state governments, local governments draw up a budget to organize their spending. The revenue they collect through taxes allows them to hire police and firefighters. Tax revenue also enables local governments to build roads; operate libraries, hospitals, and jails; and pay teachers. Even though this is the level of government closest to you, it may be the one you know the least about. Forms of Local Government You probably think of “local government” as a town or city. There are other types as well, including townships, counties, 8.4 State and Local Taxes and Spending 369 ]]></text>

Together they collect around $600 billion in tax revenues. The Jobs of Local Government Local governments carry major responsibilities in many areas, such as public school systems, law enforcement (local police, county sheriff&apos;s departments, park police), and fire protection. They manage public facilities (libraries, airports, public hospitals) and parks and recreational facilities (beaches, swimming pools, zoos). They monitor public health (restaurant inspection, water treatment, sewer systems), public transportation, elections (voter registration, ballot preparation, election supervision, vote counting), record keeping (birth/death certificates, wills, marriage licenses), and social services (food stamps, child care, welfare). From this listing of tasks, you can see that local governments touch our lives every day. Many of the tasks are reflected in Figure 8.10. In some towns and cities, separate commissions or private corporations carry out some of these responsibilities. Fulfilling local government&apos;s responsibilities is expensive. Some cities have found that their debts and other financial obligations are out of control. Stockton, California, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Local Spending, 2011 Detroit, Michigan, did the same thing in 2013. In Detroit&apos;s case, a key cause of financial difficulties was the flight of its citizens to the suburbs. As a result, the local government lost an enormous amount of revenue, especially from property taxes. Property Tax The property tax is the most significant source of tax revenue for local governments. Figure 8.11 shows that this tax contributes about a quarter of all local government revenues. Property taxes are levied on property owners in local communities to offset the expense of services such as street construction and maintenance. An official called a tax assessor determines the value of the property. Property taxes are usually figured as a fixed dollar amount per $1,000 of the assessed value. They are a main source of funding for public schools. Other Local Taxes Local taxes are similar to the types of taxes imposed by the states. Besides property taxes, local governments levy sales, excise, and income taxes. Some of these taxes affect not only residents of a community but also visitors. In fact, many are designed specifically to raise revenue from nonresidents. In this way, tourists and others from outside the local area help boost local economies. 3.2% 36.3% 2.5% 5.1% 2.6% 2.1% 2.7% 4.5% 4.4% 3.7% 2.5% 10.1% 11.1% 3.7% 5.3% SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau Education Public welfare Hospitals Health Highways Police protection Fire protection Parks and recreation Housing and community development Sewerage Government administration Interest on general debt Utilities Insurance trust expenditure Other >> Figure 8.10 Local governments supply a variety of services to many different people.

Bounce to Activate Chart Suppose you&apos;ve gone on a school trip to New York City. The room rate for your hotel is $200 a night. When you see the bill in the morning, however, it&apos;s $233! Three different taxes have been added&ndash;a 4.0 percent state sales tax, a 4.5 percent city sales tax, and a 5.875 percent hotel room occupancy tax. In addition, the city charges a Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District surcharge of 0.375 percent, for a total tax of 14.75 percent. The state and city also collect room fees totaling $3.50. Many other cities have taxes aimed at tourists and business travelers. Besides hotel taxes, they include sales taxes on rental cars, airport taxes, and taxes on movie or theater tickets. A few thousand cities and other types of local governments assess a tax on individual income. It takes the form of a payroll tax. Usually the rate is low, but this tax can still produce a significant amount of revenue. Some cities have debated the idea of instituting a congestion tax on vehicles. The local government would charge drivers a fee for entering a congested, or overcrowded, area of the city between certain hours. Supporters of a congestion tax say many commuters would opt to use mass transit instead of automobiles. This would not only help clear clogged streets, but would also decrease the emission of gases that contribute to local air pollution into the atmosphere. Critics counter that the city&apos;s businesses would be hurt, as many people would decide to stay out of the downtown area&ndash;and spend their money elsewhere.

Lesson 1: Understanding Taxes Lesson 3: Federal Spending LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.2.8 SS.912.E.2.9, LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 The U.S. Constitution gives the government the power to impose taxes, which it needs to fund its activities. Taxes with rates that rise with income are progressive; taxes with the same rate for all incomes are proportional; and taxes with rates that rise as income falls are regressive. Different taxes have different bases, such as individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, or property taxes. Tax burdens can affect economic decisions. Taxes should be simple, efficient, predictable, and fair. Lesson 2: Federal Taxes SS.912.E.2.8 Individual income taxes are the federal government&apos;s main source of revenue. Income taxes are progressive and are collected through withholding from pay. Other taxes withheld from pay include Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, and unemployment taxes. Corporations also must pay a progressive income tax. Other federal taxes include excise taxes, or taxes on the value of a good; estate taxes due when people inherit more than $5.25 million; gift taxes on gifts of more than $14,000; and tariffs on imported goods. Federal spending falls into two main categories. Mandatory spending is spending required by law. All other spending is discretionary, or optional, spending. The largest type of mandatory spending is for entitlements, payments that people are entitled to by law, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The largest area of discretionary spending is for defense. Discretionary spending also pays for education, research, law enforcement, disaster aid, and many other government programs. Federal aid to state and local governments is another type of discretionary spending. Lesson 4: State and Local Taxes and Spending ELD.K12.ELL.SI.1, HE.912.C.2.4 States prepare budgets to match their spending to their revenue. Unlike the federal government, most states require balanced budgets. State spending pays for education, public safety, highways and other transportation, health and antipoverty programs, and arts and recreation. Almost all states collect sales and excise taxes. Most states collect individual and corporate income taxes. Some states also tax property. Local governments also tax and spend. Local governments include city and county governments and school districts. Most collect property taxes. Some collect income or sales taxes. They use these to pay for school systems, police forces, and such services as parks and libraries. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="441"> <text><![CDATA[ DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTIONS LAFS.1112.RH.3.7, SS.912.E.2.9 Almost two-thirds of federal expenditures are entitlements such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. As these social welfare programs continue to grow, people debate about whether to limit their benefits in order to reduce the federal budget deficit. DOCUMENT A The Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce outlines some of the major issues surrounding entitlement programs. Today I want to discuss a challenge that impacts every single citizen, the health of our economy, and our country&apos;s ability to maintain its leadership role in the world. That challenge is the urgent need to reform and modernize our entitlement programs&ndash; primarily Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. These are safety net programs that we have enacted as a compassionate society to care for the elderly in retirement, for people with disabilities, and for those who cannot afford health insurance on their own. . . . We need to fix these programs because otherwise they will consume every dollar the government collects. There will be no money left over to improve our schools, defend our country from its enemies, clean our environment, or repair our roads and bridges. . . . Why do these programs need fixing in the first place? Because Americans are thankfully living much longer than they used to, which means they are drawing more total benefits over their lifetimes than the systems were ever designed to pay for. . . . And because Americans are having fewer children, which means relatively speaking, there are fewer workers paying into the system compared with the number of beneficiaries. &ndash;R. Bruce Josten, “10 Truths About America&apos;s Entitlement Programs,” June 8, 2013 DOCUMENT B DOCUMENT C Economist Henry J. Aaron explains his view of the importance of Social Security. . . . Social Security is, and must remain, the bedrock of retirement income security. There is simply no alternative. Private income sources cannot do what social insurance does&ndash;only social insurance provides absolute inflation protection, spreads risks over generations and across the whole population, provides wage insurance, and is immune to fluctuations in asset values. Yes, changes in economic and demographic conditions can force changes in social insurance. But those changes are gradual, not abrupt. . . . The best way of saving money and maintaining replacement rates, in my view, would be measures to encourage workers able work to remain economically active until later ages than is now customary. &ndash;Henry J. Aaron, “Health Care, Entitlements, and the Federal Budget,” June 15, 2009 22. What is one reason the author of Document A wants to cut entitlement benefits? A. They do not provide the help they were meant to provide. B. They use up funds that could be used to help the elderly. C. They eat up too large a share of the federal budget. D. They are not going to the people who most need them. 23. What problem does Document B address? A. Extending insurance coverage to everyone B. Doctors&apos; tendency to rush through appointments C. The need to shorten hospital stays D. The expense of healthcare coverage 24. According to Document C, why would it be wrong to cut Social Security? A. It provides income security to beneficiaries. B. It allows people to retire early, opening up new jobs. C. It fluctuates easily when property values change. D. It is immune to changes in the economy and population. 25. Writing Task Write a paragraph describing the costs and benefits of cutting entitlements in order to balance the federal budget. In your response, integrate the arguments presented in the three sources above, as well as any relevant information in the text (including visual information such as charts and graphs.) ]]></text>

Suppose everyone in the house had to agree on every single item in the budget, and you had to send it to somebody else for final approval. Now you have an idea what the U.S. federal government must do before it can spend your tax money. Unlike a family, the federal government is not just interested in making income meet expenses. As you will see, the government may also use its taxing and spending policies to speed up economic growth&ndash;or even to slow it down. Fiscal Policy The federal government takes in and spends huge amounts of money. In fact, it spends an average of about $10 billion every day. This tremendous flow of cash into and out of the economy has a large impact on aggregate supply and aggregate demand.

    <page pageNumber="447"> <text><![CDATA[ use of government spending and revenue collection to influence the economy. Fiscal policy is a tool used to expand or to slow economic growth, to achieve full employment, and to maintain price stability. The federal government makes key fiscal policy decisions&ndash;how much to spend and how much to tax&ndash;each year when it creates the federal budget. Federal Budget Basics The federal budget is a written document estimating the federal government&apos;s revenue and authorizing its spending for the coming year. Like any organization&apos;s budget, it lists expected income and shows exactly how the money will be spent. In effect, the budget reflects the nation&apos;s priorities&ndash;the tasks and goals it finds most pressing and worthy of financial support. Figure 9.1 helps illustrate this point by showing how the federal budget in one year was distributed among broad spending categories. It also shows how spending has changed over time. The federal government prepares a new budget for each fiscal year. A fiscal year is a 12-month period used for budgeting purposes. It is not necessarily the same as the January-to-December calendar year. The federal government uses a fiscal year that runs from October 1 through September 30. Step 1: Agencies Submit Spending Proposals The federal budget takes about 18 months to prepare. During this time, citizens, Congress, and the President debate the government&apos;s spending priorities. In fact, the budget reflects the nation&apos;s commitment to different priorities. There are several basic steps in the federal budget process. These steps are outlined in Figure 9.2. The federal budget must fund many offices and agencies in the federal government, and Congress cannot know all of their needs. So, before the budget is put together, each federal agency writes a detailed estimate of how much it expects to spend in the coming fiscal year. These spending proposals are sent to a special unit of the executive branch, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Created in 1970, the OMB is part of the Executive Office of the President. As its name suggests, the OMB is responsible for managing the federal government&apos;s budget. Its most important job is to prepare that budget. Step 2: Executive Branch Draws Up a Budget The OMB reviews the federal agencies&apos; spending proposals. Representatives from the agencies may explain their spending proposals to the OMB and try to persuade the OMB to give them as much money as they have requested.

This document reveals the President&apos;s overall spending plan for the coming fiscal year. The President presents the budget to Congress in January or February. Step 3: Congress Debates The President&apos;s budget is only a starting point. The number of changes Congress makes to the President&apos;s budget depends on the relationship between the President and Congress. Congress carefully considers, debates, and modifies the President&apos;s proposed budget. For help, members of Congress rely on the assistance of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Created in 1974, the CBO gives Congress independent economic data to help with its decisions. Much of the work done by Congress is done in small committees. Working at the same time, committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate analyze the budget and hold hearings at which agency officials and others can speak out about the budget. The House Budget Committee and Senate Budget Committee combine their work to propose one initial budget resolution, which must be adopted by May 15, before the beginning of the fiscal year. This resolution is not intended to be final. It gives initial estimates for revenue and spending to guide the legislators as they continue working on the budget. Then, in early September, the budget committees propose a second budget resolution that sets binding spending limits. Congress must pass this resolution by September 15, after which Congress cannot pass any new bills that would spend more money than the budget resolution allows. Finally, the Appropriations Committee of each house submits bills to authorize specific spending, based on the decisions Congress has made. By this time, the new fiscal year is about to start, and Congress faces pressure to get these appropriations bills adopted and submitted to the President before the previous year&apos;s funding ends on September 30. If Congress cannot finish in time, it must pass short-term emergency spending legislation known as “stopgap funding” to keep the government running. If Congress and the President cannot even agree on temporary funding, the government “shuts down,” and all but the most essential federal offices close. Step 4: Back to the White House Once Congress approves the appropriations bills, they are sent to the President, who can sign the bills into law. If the President vetoes any of the bills, Congress has two options. It can vote to override the President&apos;s veto&ndash;a difficult task, because an override requires the votes of two thirds of each chamber. More often, Congress works with the President to write an Federal agencies send requests for funding to Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB works with the President to create a budget, which the President then sends to Congress. Congress debates and makes changes to the budget and returns it to the President. President signs budget into law. President vetoes the budget. Congress overrides the President&apos;s veto by a 2/3 majority. Congress and the President compromise and agree on a new budget.

How Fiscal Policy Decisions Impact the Economy Government officials who take part in the budget process debate how much should be spent on specific programs such as defense or education. They also consider how much should be spent in all. These decisions do not affect only the specific programs in the budget&ndash;they affect the entire economy. Government spending increases or decreases can affect the nation&apos;s total economic output. Similarly, the raising or lowering of taxes may help reduce or boost output. (See Figure 9.3.) Fiscal policy that tries to increase output is known as expansionary policy. Fiscal policy intended to decrease output is called contractionary policy. By carefully choosing to follow expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy&ndash; and considering the costs of each&ndash;the federal government tries to make the economy grow as smoothly and sustainably as possible. Expansionary Fiscal Policy Governments use an expansionary fiscal policy to raise the level of output in the economy. That is, they use expansionary policy to encourage growth, either to try to prevent a recession or to move the economy out of a recession. Recall that a recession is the part of the business cycle that occurs when output declines for at least two quarters, or three-month periods, in a row. Expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending, cutting taxes, or both. If the federal government increases its spending, or buys more goods and services, it triggers a chain of events that raises output and creates jobs. Government spending increases aggregate demand, which causes prices to rise, as shown in Figure 9.4. According to the law of supply, higher prices encourage suppliers of goods and services to produce more. To do this, firms will hire more workers. In short, an increase in demand should lead to lower unemployment and to an increase in output. The economy will expand. Tax cuts can work in a similar way to encourage economic expansion. If the federal government cuts taxes, individuals keep more of their income, and 9.1 The Federal Budget and Fiscal Policy 383 ]]></text>

Consumers have more money to spend on goods and services, and firms have more money to spend on land, labor, and capital. If consumers and businesses spend the money they gain through tax cuts, this spending will increase demand, prices, and output. The U.S. government&apos;s response to the recession that began after the 2008 financial crisis illustrates expansionary fiscal policy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act both increased government spending and cut taxes. The act provided funding for road construction and repair, for scientific research, and for many other projects. It also cut payroll taxes, provided a tax credit for new home buyers, and offered other tax breaks. The goal was to increase demand, lower unemployment, and spur economic output. Contractionary Fiscal Policy Under some circumstances, the government may employ a contractionary fiscal policy. Contractionary fiscal policy tries to decrease aggregate demand and, by decreasing demand, to reduce the growth of economic output. If contractionary fiscal policy is strong enough, it may slow the growth of output to zero or even lead to a fall in gross domestic product (GDP). (See Figure 9.5.) Why would the government try to decrease economic output? The government sometimes tries to slow down the economy to fight inflation, a rapid increase in prices. Effects of Expansionary Fiscal Policy High prices Highhigher output, er prices Aggrwith higgoegate demand verher Originment spending demandnal aggregate supplyegate Lolwer ouower pricestput, Aggr Price level Low prices Low output When demand exceeds supply, producers respond by raising output and raising prices. If producers cannot expand production enough, they will raise their prices, which can lead to high inflation. Left unchecked, inflation cuts into consumers&apos; purchasing power and discourages economic growth and stability. Contractionary fiscal policy aimed at slowing the growth of total output generally involves two alternatives. The Federal government can decrease spending or raise taxes&ndash;or both. If the federal government spends less, or buys fewer goods and services, it triggers a chain of events that may lead to slower GDP growth. As Figure 9.6 indicates, government spending represents a significant share of GDP. A decrease in government spending leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, because the government is buying less than before. Decreased demand tends to lower prices. According to the law of supply, lower prices encourage suppliers to cut their production and possibly lay off workers. Lower production lowers the growth rate of the economy and may even reduce GDP. This chain of events is the exact opposite of what happens when the government increases spending. The government uses the same tools to try to influence the economy in both cases, but in different ways and with very different goals. When the federal government raises taxes, individuals have less money to spend on goods and High output >> Figure 9.4 The goal of expansionary fiscal policy is to achieve higher aggregate demand&ndash;and higher output and prices.

Firms keep less of their profits and have less money to invest in land, labor, and capital. As a result of these decreases in demand, prices tend to fall. Producers of goods and suppliers of services tend to cut production. This slows the growth of GDP. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS What are the two main tools that government uses to implement fiscal policy? The Limits and Costs of Fiscal Policy Fiscal policy can be a powerful tool that can keep the economy in balance, but it can also be clumsy and difficult to put into practice. In addition, fiscal policy decisions come at a cost. The Reality of Entitlements Increasing or decreasing federal spending is not an easy task. Many spending categories in the federal budget are entitlements that are fixed by law. Over half the federal budget is set aside for programs such as Medicaid, Social Security, and veterans&apos; benefits before Congress even begins the budget process. Government cannot change spending for entitlements under current law. Also, it must continue to pay interest on the large debt the nation has incurred. As a result, significant change in federal spending generally must come from the smaller discretionary spending part of the federal budget. This gives government little fiscal leeway. Knowing the Future Governments use fiscal policy to prevent big changes in the level of GDP. Despite the statistics, however, it is difficult to know the current state of the economy. No one can know for sure how quickly the business cycle will move from one stage to the next, nor can anyone identify exactly where in the cycle the economy is at any particular time. Predicting future economic performance is even more difficult. If economists forecast well, then the lag would not matter. They could tell Congress in advance what the appropriate fiscal policy is. But economists do not forecast well. Most economists, for example, badly under predicted both the rise in unemployment in 1981 and the strength of the recovery that began in late 1982. Absent accurate forecasts, attempts to use discretionary fiscal 9.1 The Federal Budget and Fiscal Policy 385 ]]></text>

Weil, Professor of Economics at Brown University Delayed Results Although changes in fiscal policy affect the economy, changes take time. Once officials decide to change fiscal policy, they have to put the changes into effect within the federal budget, which takes more than a year to develop. Finally, they have to wait for the changes to affect the economy. As Figure 9.7 shows, by the time a new policy takes effect, the economy might be moving in the opposite direction. Government could propose massive public spending on highways and other infrastructure in the middle of a recession, only to have the economy recover before construction begins. In cases like this, fiscal policy would only strengthen the new trend, instead of correcting the original problem. If government continued to spend freely on highways in the middle of a recovery, it could lead to high inflation and a labor shortage. Political Pressures The President and the members of Congress, who develop the federal budget and the federal government&apos;s fiscal policy, are elected officials. If they wish to be reelected, they 2010 GDP (in billions of dollars) must make decisions that please the people who elect them&ndash;not necessarily decisions that are good for the overall economy. For example, government officials have an incentive to boost spending or lower taxes. Expansionary fiscal policies are often popular with voters. Government spending benefits firms that receive government contracts and individuals who receive direct government payments. Lower taxes leave more disposable income in people&apos;s pockets. On the other hand, contractionary fiscal policy, which decreases government spending or raises taxes, is often unpopular. Firms and individuals who expect income from the government are not happy when the income is reduced. No one likes to pay higher taxes, even when the revenue is spent on a highly valued good or service. Coordinating Fiscal Policy For fiscal policy to be effective, various branches and levels of government must work together. For example, if the federal government is pursuing contractionary policy, state and local governments should, ideally, pursue a similar fiscal policy. However, this does not always happen. For example, after the federal government cut income taxes in 2001 and 2003, many state and local governments raised income and property taxes in order to fund their budgets and avoid deep spending cuts.

Businesspeople, politicians, and economists often disagree about how well the economy is performing and what the goals of fiscal policy should be. Also, different regions of the country can experience different economic conditions. Some states may have high unemployment while others face a labor shortage. In addition, in order for the federal government&apos;s fiscal policy to be effective, it must also be coordinated with the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. You will learn more about monetary policy elsewhere. Governments must recognize that short-term effects of fiscal policy will differ from long-term effects. These differing effects must be considered in evaluating the overall cost of any fiscal policy. For example, a tax cut or increased spending may give a quick boost to production and to employment. However, as the economy returns to full employment, continued high levels of government spending or increased market spending may lead to high inflation and interest rates. Similarly, an increase in taxes or fees or a decrease in government spending may “cool” the economy and avoid inflation. In the short run, reduced government spending and higher taxes may even contribute to a recession. But at the same time, such fiscal policies may create opportunities for private investment spending that could lead to higher economic growth in the long run. In this way, slow growth or even recession in the short term can lead to prosperity and more jobs in the future.

Nowadays, many of us are used to the idea that the government might use its spending power to stimulate the economy. But at the time of the Depression, this was a radical new idea. And today, there are plenty of people who think that there are better ways the government can stimulate the economy than by spending. In this text, you will look at two very different fiscal policy options the government can pursue. In a free market, people act in their own self-interest, causing prices to rise or fall so that supply and demand will always return to equilibrium.

    <page pageNumber="455"> <text><![CDATA[ basic ideas to this school. For well over a century, classical economics dominated economic theory and government policies. Some aspects of classical economic thought are still widely followed today. The Great Depression, which began in 1929, challenged the classical theory. Prices fell over several years, so demand should have increased enough to stimulate production as consumers took advantage of low prices. Instead, demand also fell as people lost their jobs and bank failures wiped out their savings. Figure 9.9 highlights the widespread economic devastation. According to classical economics, the market should have reached equilibrium, with full employment. But it didn&apos;t, and millions suffered from unemployment and other hardships. Farmers lost their farms because corn was selling for seven cents a bushel and beef for two and a half cents a pound. Yet even with these low prices, many people were too poor to buy food. The Great Depression highlighted a problem with classical economics: It did not address how long it would take for the market to return to equilibrium. Classical economists recognized that it could take some time and looked for equilibrium to reestablish itself “in the long run”&ndash;over time. One economist, who was not satisfied with the idea of simply waiting for the economy to recover on its own, commented, “In the long run we are all dead.” That economist was John Maynard Keynes (pronounced CANES). IdENTIfy What event challenged the dominance of the classical economics school of thought? Keynesian Economics British economist John Maynard Keynes developed a new theory of economics to explain the Great Depression. Keynes presented his ideas in 1936 in a book called The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. He wanted to develop a comprehensive explanation of macroeconomic forces. Such an explanation, he argued, should tell economists and politicians how to get out of economic crises like the Great Depression. In sharp contrast to classical economics, Keynes wanted to give government a tool it could use immediately to boost the economy in the short run. His theories have had a huge impact on the changing role of government in the U.S. free enterprise system. Keynes Versus Classical Economics Classical economists had always looked at how the equilibrium of supply and demand applied to SOURCE: www.britannica.com 46.8% decline in industrial production 40% drop in real GDP At least 20% maximum unemployment 33% decline in stock value 20% bank failure rate 31% decline in money supply 2.5 million people displaced from the states of the Great Plains GREAT DEPRESSION?

Productive capacity, often called full-employment output, is the maximum output that an economy can sustain over a period of time without increasing inflation. Keynes attempted to answer the difficult question posed by the Great Depression: Why does actual production in an economy sometimes fall far short of its productive capacity? Keynes argued that the Depression continued because neither consumers nor businesses had an incentive to spend enough to cause an increase in production. After all, why would a company spend money to increase production when demand for its products was falling? How could consumers significantly increase demand when they had barely enough money to survive? The only way to end the Depression, Keynes thought, was to find a way to boost aggregate demand. Economists who agreed with the idea that demand drives the economy developed a school of thought known as demand-side economics. They asked themselves this question: Who could spend enough to spur demand and revitalize production? Keynesian Economics Output High output Low output Productivity capacity Business spending Consumer spending Business spending Consumer spending Government >> Figure 9.10 Keynes sought to achieve the full productive capacity of the economy. Analyze Graphs According to Keynes, what could fill the gap between low output and full productive capacity? Changing Government&apos;s Role in the Economy Keynes thought that the answer to that question was: the federal government. (See Figure 9.10.) He reasoned that in the early 1930s, only the federal government still had the resources to spend enough to affect the whole economy. The government could, in effect, make up for the drop in private spending by buying goods and services on its own. This, Keynes argued, would encourage production and increase employment. Then, as people went back to work, they would spend their wages on more goods and services, leading to even higher levels of production. This ever-expanding cycle would carry the economy out of the Great Depression. Once the crisis was over, Keynes believed, the government could step back and reduce its spending. These ideas form the core of Keynes&apos;s approach to resolving problems with the economy. Keynesian economics uses demand-side theory as the basis for encouraging government action to help the economy. In other words, Keynesian economics proposes that government can and should use fiscal policy to help the economy. Keynes argued that fiscal policy can combat the two fundamental macroeconomic problems: periods of recession and periods of inflation. Avoiding Recession The federal government, Keynes argued, should keep track of the total level of spending by consumers, businesses, and government. If total spending begins to fall far below the level required to keep the economy running at full capacity, the government should watch out for the possibility of recession. The government can respond by increasing its own spending until spending by the private sector returns to a higher level. Or it can cut taxes so that spending and investment by consumers and businesses increase. Raising government spending and cutting taxes are expansionary fiscal policies. After he was elected President in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt carried out expansionary fiscal policies. His New Deal put people to work&ndash;whether planting forests, building dams and schools, or painting murals. The federal government paid for all these programs. Classical economists criticized these programs. Even today, many people argue that instead of creating new jobs, such public works projects only shift employment from the private to the public sector. The dispute over Keynes&apos;s ideas is generally reflected today in the philosophies of the two political parties. Republicans generally have been 390 TOPIC 9 Fiscal and Monetary Policy ]]></text>

Keynes and Inflation Keynes also argued that the government could use a contractionary fiscal policy to prevent inflation or reduce its severity. The government can reduce inflation either by increasing taxes or by reducing its own spending. Both of these actions decrease overall demand. The Multiplier Effect Fiscal policy, although difficult to control, is a powerful tool. The key to its power is the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect in fiscal policy is the idea that each dollar spent or not taxed by government creates a change much greater than one dollar in the national income. In other words, the effects of changes in fiscal policy are multiplied. Suppose the federal government finds that business investment is dropping. To prevent a recession, in the next budget the government decides to spend an extra $10 billion to stimulate the economy. How will this affect the economy? With this government spending, demand, income, and GDP will increase by $10 billion. After all, if the government buys an extra $10 billion of goods and services, then an extra $10 billion of goods and services have been produced. However, the GDP could increase by more than $10 billion. Here&apos;s why: The businesses that sold the $10 billion in goods and services to the government have earned an additional $10 billion. These businesses will spend their additional earnings on wages, raw materials, and investment, sending money to workers, other suppliers, and stockholders. What will the recipients do with this money? They will spend part of it. Suppose they spend 80 percent of it, or $8 billion. The businesses that benefit from this second round of spending will then pass it back to households and other businesses, who will again spend 80 percent of it, or $6.4 billion. The next round will add an additional $5.1 billion to the economy, and so on. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 9.11. In this example, when all of the rounds of spending are added up, the initial spending of $10 billion adds about $50 billion to GDP. So, fiscal policy initiatives can have a bigger kick than the initial amount spent. Note, though, that not all spending multiplies at the same rate. For example, the multiplier effect on borrowed money may be greatly reduced. THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT $10B $8B $6.4B $5.1B GDP + + + $10 BILLION. Government spends an GDP INCREASES additional $10 billion. $8 BILLION. Recipients of the $10 billion GDP INCREASES spend $8 billion of it. $6.4 BILLION. Recipients of the $8 billion GDP INCREASES spend $6.4 billion of it. And so on…until the original $10 billion spending has INCREASED GDP BY $50 BILLION. $5.1 BILLION. Recipients of the $6.4 billion GDP INCREASES spend $5.1 billion of it. >> Figure 9.11 The multiplier effect helps explain how government spending boosts the economy.

    <page pageNumber="458"> <text><![CDATA[ The Role of Automatic Stabilizers Fiscal policy is used to achieve many economic goals. One of the most important things that fiscal policy can achieve is a more stable economy. A stable economy is one in which there are no rapid changes in economic indicators, which include stock prices, interest rates, and manufacturers&apos; new orders of capital goods. What&apos;s more, set up properly, fiscal policy can come close to stabilizing the economy automatically. Figure 9.12 shows how real GDP in the United States changed in the years following 1930. Prior to World War II, there were often large changes in GDP from year to year. Although GDP still fluctuates, these fluctuations have been smaller than they were before the war. Economic growth has been much more stable in the United States in the last 70 or so years. Why did this happen? After the war, federal taxes and spending on transfer payments&ndash;two key tools of fiscal policy&ndash;increased sharply. National taxes and transfer payments, or transfers of cash from the government to consumers, stabilize economic growth. When national income is high, the government collects more in taxes and pays out less in transfer payments. Both of these actions take money away from consumers, and therefore reduce spending. This decrease in spending balances out the increase in spending that results from rising income in a healthy economy. Annual Change in GDP, 1930–2012 The opposite is also true. When income in the country is low, the government collects less in taxes and pays out more in transfer payments. Both actions increase the amount of money held by consumers, and thus increase spending. This increase in spending balances out the decrease in spending resulting from decreased income. Figure 9.13 shows the recent fluctuations in one type of transfer payment&ndash;food stamps. Taxes and transfer payments do not eliminate changes in the rate of growth of GDP, but they do make these changes smaller. Because they help make economic growth more stable, they are known as stabilizers. Policymakers do not have to make changes in taxes and transfer payments for them to have their stabilizing effect. Taxes and most transfer payments are tied to the GDP and to personal income, so they change automatically. Thus, they are called automatic stabilizers&ndash;tools of fiscal policy that increase or decrease automatically depending on changes in GDP and personal income. Some stabilizers are no longer automatic. The former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), often called welfare, lost its entitlement status in 1996 and was renamed Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Now the federal government gives the states a set amount of money each year to spend as they wish. However, the stabilizer effect was not completely lost.

IdENTIfy MAIN IdEAS How did Keynes propose to end the Great Depression? Supply-Side Economics Another school of economic thought promotes a different direction for fiscal policy. Supply-side economics is based on the idea that the supply of goods drives the economy. Whereas Keynesian economics tries to encourage economic growth by increasing aggregate demand, supply-side economics relies on increasing aggregate supply. It does this by focusing on taxes. In recent years, supply-side economics has had a significant impact on the U.S. economy and free enterprise system. Analyzing the Laffer Curve Supply-side economists believe that taxes have a strong negative impact on economic output. They often use the Laffer curve, named after the economist Arthur Laffer, to illustrate the effects of taxes. The Laffer curve (Figure 9.14) presents a supply-side view of the relationship between the tax rate and the total tax revenue that the government collects. The total revenue depends on both the tax rate and the health of the economy. The Laffer curve suggests that high tax rates may not bring in much revenue if they cause economic activity to decrease. Suppose the government imposes a tax on the wages of workers. If the tax rate is zero, as at point a on the graph, the government will collect no revenue, although the economy will benefit from the lack of taxes. As the government raises the tax rate, it starts to collect some revenue. You can see this change in Figure 9.14. From a 0 percent tax rate (point a) to a 50 percent tax rate on the curve (point b), rising tax rates begin to discourage some people from working as many hours as they might, and hinder companies from investing and increasing production. The net effect of a higher tax rate and a slightly lower tax base is still an increase in revenue. At tax rates higher than 50 percent, the decrease in workers&apos; effort is so large that the higher tax rate actually decreases total tax revenue. In other words, high rates of taxation will eventually discourage so many people from working that tax revenues will fall. In the extreme case of a 100 percent tax rate, no one would want to work! In this case, shown at point c on the curve, the government would collect no revenue. 9.2 Fiscal Policy Options 393 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="460"> <text><![CDATA[ The Relationship Between Taxes and Output The heart of the supply-side argument is that a tax cut increases total employment so much that the government actually collects more in taxes at the new, lower tax rate. Suppose the initial tax on labor is $3 an hour, and the typical worker works 30 hours per week, paying a total of $90 in taxes each week. If the government cuts the tax on labor to $2 an hour, and the worker responds by working 50 hours per week, the worker will pay $100 in taxes a week, an increase of $10. Figure 9.15 shows the increase in government revenues during a time when government was at least partly following supply-side policies. The economic growth of the 1980s was impressive, but it is hard to pin down the role that U.S. supply-side economic policies played in this outcome. Some economists argue that although a tax cut encourages some workers to work more hours, the end result is a relatively small increase in the number of hours worked. Take the example of the worker above. These economists would say that if the tax cut increased the hours worked from 30 hours to 35 hours, the worker would pay only $70 in taxes ($2 per hour times 35 hours), down from $90 ($3 per hour times 30 hours). In general, these economists argue, taxpayers do not react strongly enough to tax cuts to increase tax revenue. Laffer Curve High revenues As you can see, there is much debate over the relationship between tax rates and output. In addition to being an economic question, this debate plays a major role in American politics today. ChECK UNdERSTANdINg How does the supply-side economics theory link taxation to employment levels? The Recent History of U.S. Fiscal Policy As you recall, Keynes presented his ideas at a time when the world economy was engulfed in a severe economic downturn. President Herbert Hoover, a strong believer in classical economics, thought that the economy was basically sound and would return to equilibrium on its own, without government interference. His successor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was more willing to increase government spending to help boost the economy. World War II Keynes&apos;s theory was fully tested in the United States during World War II. As the country geared up for war, government spending increased dramatically.

This money was given to the private sector in exchange for goods. Just as Keynesian economics predicted, the additional demand for goods and services moved the country sharply out of the Great Depression and toward full productive capacity. The enormous government spending during the war boosted output and greatly reduced unemployment. But the benefits of this U.S. economic policy also had costs. Until the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, the federal government had sought to balance its budget, spending no more than it received in revenue. During the New Deal and World War II, expenditures exceeded revenues, a situation known as deficit spending. To finance deficit spending, the government has to borrow money, for which it pays interest. This represents a financial cost as well as an opportunity cost&ndash;the money used to pay interest cannot be used for other purposes. Postwar Keynesian Policy After World War II ended, Congress created the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Made up of three respected economists, the CEA advised the President on economic policy. Between 1945 and 1960, the U.S. economy was generally healthy and growing, despite a few minor recessions. The last recession continued into the term of President John F. Kennedy, with unemployment reaching a level of 6.7 percent. Kennedy&apos;s chief financial policy adviser, chairperson of the CEA Walter Heller, thought that the economy was below its productive capacity. He convinced Kennedy that tax cuts would stimulate demand and bring the economy closer to full productive capacity. As Figure 9.16 shows, the highest marginal tax rate on individual income was about 90 percent in the early 1960s&ndash;compared with a top rate of 39.6 in 2013. Kennedy proposed tax cuts, both because he agreed with Heller and because tax cuts are popular. A version of Kennedy&apos;s tax cuts was enacted in 1964, under President Lyndon Johnson. At the same time, the Vietnam War raised government spending. Over two years, consumption and GDP increased by more than 4 percent a year. There is no way to prove that the tax cut caused this growth, but the result was generally what Keynesian economics predicted. Keynesian economics was used often in the 1960s and 1970s. One Keynesian economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, greatly influenced national policies. Galbraith, a strong supporter of public spending, helped develop the far-reaching&ndash;and enormously costly&ndash;social welfare programs that lay at the heart of President Johnson&apos;s vision of a Great Society.

When Ronald Reagan became President in 1981, he vowed to cut taxes and spending. An “anti-Keynesian,” Reagan did not believe that government should spend its way out of a recession: Government spending has become so extensive that it contributes to the economic problems it was designed to cure. More government intervention in the economy cannot possibly be a solution to our economic problems. &ndash;Ronald Reagan, White House Report on the Program for Economic Recovery, 1981 Reagan instituted policies based on supply-side economics, a theory promoted by economists such as George Gilder. Among Reagan&apos;s advisers was Milton Friedman, a former professor of economics. Friedman strongly supported individual freedom and pushed for more laissez-faire policies&ndash;hallmarks of classical and supply-side economics. He also supported a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget. In 1981, Reagan proposed a tax cut that reduced taxes by 25 percent over three years. In a short time, the economy recovered and Top Marginal Tax Rate, 1925–Present flourished. Still, tax cuts plus an expanded defense budget led to further deficit spending, just as following Keynesian policy would have done. Under the next few Presidents, the federal government spent much more money than it took in. As you will read in the next lesson, this gap caused increasing concern among economists and policymakers. A Return to Keynes In late 2008, the United States was hit with what many economists believed was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. A number of major financial institutions failed. Credit became harder to get, consumer spending dropped, and unemployment rose. The crisis occurred in the midst of what news commentators named the Great Recession, an economic downturn that had begun in December 2007. In November 2008, voters elected a new President, Barack Obama. He promised to take firm action to stimulate the economy. Obama signed a stimulus bill in February 2009 that aimed to boost demand and create jobs. The $840 billion package included contracts, grants, and loans for education, transportation, and infrastructure projects. It also included a set of tax cuts and additional entitlement payments. To many observers, such proposals seemed to signal a shift back to a Keynesian fiscal policy, as in the New Deal. 100 90 80 70 10 20 30 40 50 60 1925 1935 1945 1955 Top Marginal Tax Rate(percent of income) Year SOURCE: Tax Policy Center: Urban Institute and Brookings Institute 1965 1975 1995 20051985 2015 >> Figure 9.16 The top marginal tax rates&ndash;rates affecting the highest incomes&ndash;have varied widely over the last century.

John Maynard Keynes argued that governments had to create money and inject it into the economy to help create jobs. Keynes&apos;s General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money was published in 1936. President Roosevelt&apos;s New Deal program followed Keynes&apos;s advice. Some economists, including Friedrich Hayek, disagreed, arguing that too much government spending could lead to inflation and other economic problems. In a 1950 speech, Hayek stated his views. >> Economists disagree about the economic role of government agencies and the Federal Reserve System, whose headquarters is shown here. general Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money: John Maynard Keynes . . . The State will have to exercise a guiding influence on the propensity to consume. . . . Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the influence of banking policy on the rate of interest will be sufficient by itself to determine an optimum rate of investment. I conceive, therefore, that a somewhat comprehensive socialisation [shift to the government] of investment will prove the only means of securing an approximation to full employment . . . But beyond this no obvious case is made out for a system of State Socialism which would embrace most of the economic life of the community. It is not the ownership of the instruments of production which it is important for the State to assume. If the State is able to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments and the basic rate of reward to those who own them, it will have accomplished all that is necessary. ExPLAIN AN ARgUMENT What does Keynes argue that government needs to do? What does he argue that it need not do? . . . The central controls necessary to ensure full employment will, of course, involve a large extension of the traditional functions of government. . . . But there will still remain a wide field for the exercise of private initiative and responsibility. . . . Whilst, therefore, the enlargement of the functions of government, involved in the task of adjusting to one another the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest, would seem . . . to a contemporary American financier to be a terrific encroachment on individualism, I defend it, on the contrary, both as the only practicable means of avoiding the destruction of existing economic forms in their entirety and as the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.

That in most situations employment can be temporarily increased by monetary expansion [that is, inflation] has long been known. . . .What is new about present beliefs is that it is now widely held that so long as monetary expansion creates additional employment, it is innocuous or at least will cause more benefit than harm. Yet while in practice full employment policies merely mean that in the short run employment is kept somewhat higher than it would otherwise be, it is at least doubtful whether over longer periods they will not in fact lower the level of employment which can be permanently maintained without progressive monetary expansion. These policies are however constantly represented as if the practical problem were not this but as if the choice were between full employment thus defined and the lasting mass unemployment of the nineteen-thirties.

The government uses spending as a fiscal policy tool to improve the economy. The basic tool of fiscal policy is the federal budget. It is made up of two fundamental parts: revenue (taxes) and expenditures (spending programs). When the federal government&apos;s revenues equal its expenditures in any particular fiscal year, the federal government has a balanced budget. In reality, the federal budget is almost never balanced. Usually, it is either running a surplus or a deficit. A budget surplus occurs in any year when revenues exceed expenditures. In other words, there is more money going into the Treasury than coming outofit. A budget deficit occurs in any year when expenditures exceed revenues. In other words, there is more money coming out of the Treasury than going into it. Deficits have become a common characteristic of the economy in recent decades.

This analysis also explains budget deficits. If the government increases expenditures without changing anything else, it will run a deficit. Similarly, if it decreases taxes without changing anything else, it will run a deficit. The deficit can grow or shrink because of forces beyond the government&apos;s control. Surpluses and deficits can be very large figures. The largest deficit, in 2009, was over $1.4 trillion. Dealing With Deficits When the government runs a deficit, it is because it did not take in enough revenue to cover its expenses for the year. When this happens, the government must find a way to pay for the extra expenditures. There are two basic actions the government can take to do so. Creating Money The government can create new money to pay salaries for its workers and benefits for citizens. Traditionally, governments simply printed the bills they needed. Today, the government can create money electronically by actions that effectively deposit money in people&apos;s bank accounts. The effect is the same. This approach works for relatively small deficits but can cause severe problems when there are large deficits. What are these problems? When the government creates more money, it increases the amount of money in circulation. This increases the demand for goods and services and can increase output. But once the economy reaches full employment, output cannot increase. The increase in money will mean that there are more dollars but the same amount of goods and services. Prices will rise so that a greater amount of money will be needed to purchase the same amount of goods and services. In other words, prices go up, and the result is inflation. Covering very large deficits by printing more money can cause hyperinflation. This happened in Germany and Russia after World War I, in Brazil and Argentina in the 1980s, and in Ukraine in the 1990s. If the United States experienced hyperinflation, a shirt that cost $30 in June might cost $50 in July, $80 in August, and $400 in December! Borrowing Money The U.S. federal government usually does not resort to creating money to cover a budget deficit. Instead, it borrows money. The government commonly borrows money by selling bonds. A bond is a type of loan: a promise to repay money in the future, with interest. Consumers and businesses buy bonds from the government.

    <page pageNumber="468"> <text><![CDATA[ government thus has the money to cover its budget deficit. In return, the purchasers of the bonds earn interest on their investment over time. United States Savings Bonds (“EE Bonds”) allow millions of Americans to lend small amounts of money to the federal government. In return, they earn interest on the bonds for up to 30 years. Other common forms of government borrowing are Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Treasury bills are short-term bonds that have maturity dates of 26 weeks or less. Treasury notes have terms of 2 to 10 years. Treasury bonds mature 30 years after issue. Federal borrowing lets the government undertake more projects than it could otherwise afford. Wise borrowing allows the government to create more public goods and services. Federal borrowing, however, also has serious disadvantages. RECALL What is the most common method the federal government uses to pay for expenditures that exceed revenues? Deficits and the National Debt Like people, when the government borrows money, it goes into debt. The national debt is the total amount of money the federal government owes to National Debt as a Percentage of GDP bondholders. Every year that there is a budget deficit and the federal government borrows money to cover it, the national debt will grow. The national debt is owed to investors who hold Treasury bonds, bills, and notes. These bonds are considered to be among the safest investments in the world. As such, they offer a secure investment for individuals and businesses. Because the United States is widely viewed as stable and trustworthy, the federal government can borrow money at a lower rate of interest than private citizens or corporations can. Lower interest rates benefit taxpayers by reducing the cost of government borrowing. The Difference Between Deficit and Debt Many people are confused about the difference between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is the amount of money the government borrows for one budget, representing one fiscal year. The debt, on the other hand, is the sum of all the government borrowing before that time, minus the borrowings that have been repaid. Each deficit adds to the debt. Each surplus subtracts from it. Measuring the National Debt In dollar terms, the size of the national debt is extremely large. By the end of 2013, it exceeded $17 trillion!

PRIVATE BUSINESSES (GDP) over time. This can be seen in Figure 9.19. Historically, debt as a percentage of GDP rises during wartime, when government spending increases faster than taxation, and it falls during peacetime. Notice how this characteristic of the U.S. economy has changed in recent times. In the 1980s, the United States began to run a large debt, even though the country wasn&apos;t at war. The debt was in part a result of increases in spending during President Ronald Reagan&apos;s terms. In addition, the Reagan administration also cut taxes. The combined effect of higher spending and lower tax rates was several years of increased budget deficits. The impact of these fiscal policy decisions on the economy was significant. The government borrowed billions of dollars to cover the deficits, adding to the national debt. As a result, the ratio of debt to GDP grew very large for peacetime. ChECK UNdERSTANdINg To whom does the government owe the national debt? The Impact of Debt The growth of the national debt during the Reagan administration led many to focus on the problems caused by a national debt. In general, three problems can arise from a national debt. Problems of a National Debt The first problem with a national debt is that it reduces the funds available for businesses to invest. This is because in order to sell its bonds, the government must offer a higher interest rate. Individuals and businesses, attracted by the higher interest rates and the security of investing in the government, use their savings or profits to purchase government bonds. Take a look at Figure 9.20. It explains how every dollar spent on a government bond is one fewer dollar that can be invested in private business. Less money is available for companies to expand their factories, conduct research, and develop new products, and so interest rates rise. This loss of funds for private investment caused by government borrowing is called the crowding-out effect. Federal borrowing “crowds out” private borrowing by making it harder for private businesses to borrow. A national debt, then, can hurt investment and slow economic growth over the long run. In this way, fiscal policy decisions can have a significant impact on how the economy and the free enterprise system function. The second problem with a high national debt is that the government must pay interest to bondholders. The more the government borrows, the more interest it has to pay. Paying the interest on the debt is sometimes called servicing the debt. 9.3 The National Debt and Deficits 403 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="470"> <text><![CDATA[ Over time, the interest payments have become very large. About the year 2000, the federal government spent about $250 billion a year servicing the debt. Moreover, there is an opportunity cost&ndash;dollars spent servicing the debt cannot be spent on something else, such as defense, healthcare, or infrastructure. A possible third problem involves foreign ownership of the national debt. The biggest holder of that debt is the United States government itself. The government uses bonds as a secure savings account for holding Social Security, Medicare, and other funds. But about a quarter of the debt is owned by foreign governments, including Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. Some critics of the debt fear that a country like China could use its large bond holdings as a tool to extract favors from the United States. Others disagree, arguing that foreign states own too little of the debt to cause any concern. Other Views on the National Debt Some people insist that the national debt is not a big problem. (You can see an example of such a view in Figure 9.21.) Traditional Keynesian economists believe that fiscal policy is an important tool that can be used to help achieve full productive capacity. To these analysts, the benefits of a productive economy outweigh the costs of interest on national debt. In the short term, deficit spending may help create jobs and encourage economic growth. However, a budget deficit can be an effective tool only if it is temporary. Most people agree that if the government runs large budget deficits year after year, the costs of the growing debt will eventually outweigh the benefits. IdENTIfy What are the problems of having a large national debt? Measures to Control the Deficit During the 1980s and the early 1990s, annual budget deficits added substantially to the national debt. Several factors frustrated lawmakers in their attempts to control the deficit. As we have seen, much of the budget consists of entitlement spending that is politically difficult to change. Another large part of the budget consists of interest that must be paid to bondholders. Finally, specific budget cuts are often opposed by interest groups. Reducing Deficits Concerns about the budget deficits of the mid-1980s caused Congress to “Recent and projected growth in U.S. government debt poses a serious hazard to the nation. At a minimum, high levels of government debt mean substantial government resources must go toward servicing debt&ndash;to pay interest.” J.D. Foster, Ph.D, The Heritage Foundation, June 18, 2013 “With so many economic, political, and social problems facing us today, there is little point in focusing attention on something that is not one.

The automatic nature of the cuts saved lawmakers from having to make difficult decisions about individual funding cuts. However, the act exempted significant portions of the budget (including interest payments and many entitlement programs such as Social Security) from the cuts. The Supreme Court found that some parts of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act were unconstitutional. Congress attempted to correct the flaws. In 1990, however, lawmakers realized that the deficit was going to be much larger than expected. Because Congress had exempted so many programs from automatic cuts, funding for nonexempt programs would be dramatically slashed. To resolve the crisis, President George H. W. Bush and congressional leaders negotiated a new budget system that replaced Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The 1990 Budget Enforcement Act created a “pay-as-yougo” system (also known as PAYGO). PAYGO required Congress to raise enough revenue to cover increases in direct spending that would otherwise contribute to the budget deficit. This law expired in 2002, but in 2007 the House and Senate restored PAYGO in the form of special budget rules. At various times, citizens and politicians have suggested amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget. In 1995, a balanced budget amendment gained the two-thirds majority it needed to pass the House, but the next year it failed by a single vote in the Senate. Supporters argued that the amendment would force the federal government to be more disciplined about its spending. Opponents said that a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget would not give the government the flexibility it needed to deal with rapid changes in the economy. The Surpluses of the Late 1990s The late 1990s brought a welcome reversal of fortune. For the first time in thirty years, the President and the Office of Management and Budget were able to announce that the federal government was running a surplus. How did this happen? First, the new budget procedures begun under President Bush and extended under President Clinton helped Congress control the growth of government spending. Second, tax increases by President Clinton in 1993 resulted in more federal revenue. Finally, the strong economy and low unemployment meant that more individuals and corporations were earning more money&ndash;and thus paying more to the government in taxes. >> This 1993 magazine reflected a booming market for personal computers&ndash;a boom that played a key role in the fast-growing economy of the 1990s. A Return to Deficit Spending The changeover from deficits to surplus brought with it a different set of political concerns. Investors who had come to rely heavily upon Treasury bonds as the basic “safe” investment worried that the federal government would remove all bonds from the market as it repaid its debt. Americans debated how to make best use of the budget surplus. As a presidential candidate in 2000, George W. Bush pledged to use the surplus to guarantee Social Security into the new century, provide additional medical benefits to older people, and reduce income taxes. However, the surplus was short-lived. The end of the stock market boom, an economic slowdown, and a new federal income tax cut reduced federal revenues. The Islamist terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, dealt a double blow to the federal budget by disrupting the economy and imposing a new set of defense costs. You can see how these costs affected government spending in Figure 9.22. In response, the federal government returned to deficit spending. The federal budget continued to show a large deficit for the next several years, due in part to counterterrorism efforts and the very costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The Federal Reserve is responsible for putting money into circulation. How does this money get into the economy? The process is called money creation, and it is carried out by the Fed and by banks all around the country. This process is similar to the multiplier effect of government spending. The multiplier effect in fiscal policy holds that every one-dollar change in fiscal policy creates a change greater than one dollar in the economy. The process of money creation works in much the same way. How Banks Create Money Money creation does not mean the printing of new bills. Banks create money not by printing it, but by simply going about their business. For example, suppose you take out a loan of $1,000. You decide to deposit the money in a checking account.

It is counted as part of what economists call M1&ndash;the total amount of money people can gain access to and spend readily. So, as a result of this loan and deposit, the money supply has increased by $1,000. The process of money creation begins here. Banks make money by charging interest on loans. Your bank will lend part of the $1,000 that you deposited. The maximum amount that a bank can lend is determined by the required reserve ratio (RRR)&ndash;the fraction of deposits that banks are required to keep in reserve. This is calculated as the ratio of reserves to deposits. The RRR, which is established by the Federal Reserve, ensures that banks will have enough funds to supply customers&apos; withdrawal needs. Suppose in our example that the RRR is 0.1, or 10 percent. This means that the bank is required to keep 10 percent of your $1,000 demand deposit balance, or $100, in reserve. It is allowed to lend $900. Follow along in Figure 9.23 to see what happens to this money next. Let&apos;s say the bank lends that $900 to Kai, and he deposits it in his checking account. Kai now has $900 he didn&apos;t have before. Kai&apos;s $900 is now included in M1. You still have your $1,000 in your account, on which you can write a check at any time. Thus, your initial deposit to the bank and the subsequent loan have caused the money supply to increase by $1,000 + $900 for a total of $1,900. Now suppose that Kai uses the $900 to buy Lena&apos;s old car. Lena deposits the $900 from Kai into her checking account. Her bank keeps 10 percent of the deposit, or $90, as required reserves. It will lend the other $810 to its customers. So, Lena has a demand deposit balance of $900, which is included in the money supply, and the new borrowers get $810, which is also added to the money supply. This means that the money supply has now increased by $1,000 + $900 + $810 = $2,710&ndash;all because of your initial $1,000 deposit. The Money Multiplier This money creation process will continue until the loan amount, and hence the amount of new money that can be created, becomes very small. To determine the total amount of new money that can be created and added to the money supply, economists use the money multiplier formula, which is calculated as 1 ÷ RRR. To apply the formula, they multiply the initial deposit by the money multiplier: Increase in money supply = initial cash deposit × 1/RRR. In our example the RRR is 0.1, so the ++= MONEY CREATION You deposit $1,000into your checking account. Your $1,000deposit minus $100in reserves is loaned to Kai, who gives it to Lena. Lena&apos;s $900deposit minus $90in reserves is loaned to another customer. At this point, the money supply has increased by $2,710. $1,000 $900 $810 $2,710 HELD IN RESERVE $100 AVAILABLE FOR LOANS $900 HELD IN RESERVE $90 AVAILABLE FOR LOANS $810 $ $ >> Figure 9.23 Money is created as banks loan out money not kept in reserve.

Analyze Charts What would the increase in money supply be if the RRR in this example were 0.2? money multiplier is 1 ÷ 0.1 = 10. (See Figure 9.24.) This means that the deposit of $1,000 can lead to a $10,000 increase in the money supply. As of 2012, banks in the United States had no reserve requirements on the first $12.4 million of demand deposit assets. They were required to hold 3 percent reserves on demand deposit assets between $12.4 and $79.5 million, and 10 percent on all demand deposit assets exceeding $79.5 million. In the real world, however, people hold some cash outside of the banking system, meaning that some funds leak out of the money multiplier process. Also, banks sometimes hold excess reserves, which are reserves greater than the required amounts. These excess reserves ensure that banks will always be able to meet their customers&apos; demands and the Fed&apos;s reserve requirements. The actual money multiplier effect in the United States is estimated to be between 2 and 3. The Federal Reserve has three basic tools to implement U.S. monetary policy and adjust the amount of money in the economy. These tools for creating money (or destroying it, if need be) are reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations. dESCRIbE How do banks create money by going about their ordinary business? Monetary Tool #1: Reserve Requirements The simplest way for the Fed to adjust the amount of reserves in the banking system is to change the required reserve ratio. (See Figure 9.25.) The Fed&apos;s Board of Governors has sole responsibility over changes in reserve requirements. However, changing the reserve requirement is not the Fed&apos;s preferred tool. A reduction of the RRR frees up reserved money in banks, allowing them to make more loans. It also increases the money multiplier. Both effects will lead to a substantial expansion of the money supply. The process also works in reverse. Even a slight increase in the RRR forces banks to hold more money in reserves. This causes a contraction in the money supply. Although changing reserve requirements can be an effective means of changing the money supply, the Fed does not use this tool often because it is disruptive to the banking system. Even a small increase in the RRR would force banks to “call in” significant numbers of loans&ndash;that is, to require some borrowers to pay the entire outstanding balance of their loans sooner than planned. This can be difficult for the borrower. For this reason, the Fed rarely changes reserve requirements. 9.4 Monetary Policy Options 409 ]]></text>

ChECK UNdERSTANdINg What effect would a reduction in the required reserve rate (RRR) have on banks? Monetary Tool #2: The Discount Rate In the past, the Fed lowered or raised the discount rate to increase or decrease the money supply. The discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges on loans to financial institutions. Today, the discount rate is primarily used to ensure that sufficient funds are available in the economy. For example, during a financial crisis, there may not be enough funds in the banking system to provide the necessary loans to businesses and individuals. In that case, the ability of banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve at the discount rate provides a key safety net. Today, to implement monetary policy, the Federal Reserve primarily adjusts the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge one another for loans. It does not actually set a new federal funds rate, however. Instead, it decides on a “target” level for the rate and takes steps to reach that target. These steps are part of the Fed&apos;s open market operations, which you will read about shortly. The Fed does set the discount rate, and it keeps this rate above the federal funds rate. Banks usually choose to borrow from one another at the funds rate. Only if they need additional reserves will they turn to the Federal Reserve and borrow at the higher discount rate. Changes in the federal funds and discount rates affect the cost of borrowing for banks or other financial institutions. In turn, these changes affect the prime rate. The prime rate is the rate banks charge on short-term loans to their best customers&ndash; usually large companies with good credit ratings. Ultimately, other interest rates follow, including the rates banks pay on savings accounts and the rates they charge for personal loans. The discount rate, federal funds rate, and prime rate are short-term rates. They determine the cost of borrowing for a few hours, days, or months, These rates have a limited impact on long-term economic growth. To influence long-term rates, the Fed must use other tools.

Identify Steps in a Process What steps would lead to a reduction in the money supply through open market operations? Bounce to Activate Chart Monetary Tool #3: Open Market Operations Open market operations are the buying and selling of government securities in order to alter the supply of money. (See Figure 9.26.) A security is a financial document, such as a stock certificate or bond, that represents ownership of corporate shares or the promise of repayment by a company or government. Today open market operations are by far the most important&ndash;and most often used&ndash;tool employed by the Fed to implement U.S. monetary policy. Purchasing Government Securities When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chooses to increase the money supply, it orders the trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to purchase a certain quantity of government securities on the open market. The Federal Reserve Bank buys these securities with checks drawn on Federal Reserve funds. The bond sellers then deposit the money from the bond sales into their banks. As the Federal Reserve Board explains: [T]he bank now has more reserves than it wants. So the bank can lend these unwanted reserves to another bank in the federal funds market. Thus, the Fed&apos;s open market purchase increases the supply of reserves to the banking system, and the federal funds rate falls. &ndash;“What Are Open Market Operations?” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco In this way, funds enter the banking system, setting in motion the money creation process described earlier. Selling Government Securities If the FOMC chooses to decrease the money supply, it must make an open market bond sale. In this case, the Fed sells government securities back to bond dealers, receiving from them checks drawn on their own banks. After the Fed processes these checks, the money is out of circulation. This operation reduces reserves in the banking system. In order to keep their reserves at the required levels, banks reduce their outstanding loans. The money multiplier process then works in reverse, resulting in a decline in the money supply that is greater than the value of the initial securities purchase. 9.4 Monetary Policy Options 411 ]]></text>

Targets To judge whether its open market operations are having the desired effect on the economy, the Fed periodically evaluates one or more economic targets. You have read about how the federal funds rate serves as the main target for interest rates. The Fed also keeps an eye on various measures of the money supply. Close analysis of these targets helps the Fed meet its goal of promoting a stable and prosperous economy. RECALL What action does the Federal Open Market Committee take if it wants to decrease the money supply? Using Monetary Policy Tools Open market operations are the most often used of the Federal Reserve&apos;s monetary policy tools. They can be conducted smoothly and on an ongoing basis to meet the Fed&apos;s goals. The Fed changes the discount rate less frequently. It usually follows a policy of keeping the discount rate in line with other interest rates in the economy in order to prevent excess borrowing by member banks from the Fed, which might threaten economic stability. Today, the Fed does not change reserve requirements to conduct monetary policy. Changing reserve requirements would force banks to make drastic changes in their plans. Open market operations or changes in the discount rate do not disrupt financial institutions. During the recent financial crisis of 2007–2009, the Fed took aggressive action to stabilize the financial system and promote economic growth. It used open market operations to lower the federal funds rate to nearly zero. The goal was to stimulate more lending and help boost economic activity, but it was still not enough to stem the crisis. So the Fed took an additional, unconventional step: It purchased longer-term securities from banks in the hope of bringing down long-term interest rates. This action pumped billions of dollars into the financial system and helped ease the crisis. But this action did come at a potential cost, as some economists worried that it would lead to inflation. In setting its monetary policy goals, the Federal Reserve keeps a close eye on market forces, studying inflation and business cycles to determine its policy. As you just read, changes in the money supply affect interest rates. You will find out more about how this process works shortly.

Monetary policy alters the supply of money. The supply of money, in turn, affects interest rates. Interest rates affect the level of investment and spending in the economy. (See Figure 9.27.) How Money Supply Impacts Interest Rates It is easy to see the cost of money if you are borrowing it. The cost&ndash;the price that you, as a borrower, pay&ndash;is the interest rate. Even if you spend your own money, the interest rate still affects you because you are giving up interest by not saving or investing. The market for money is like any other market. If the supply is higher, the price&ndash;the interest rate&ndash;is lower. If the supply is lower, the price is higher. In other words, when the money supply is high, interest rates are low. When the money supply is low, interest rates are high. How Interest Rates Affect Spending Recall that interest rates are important factors of spending in the economy.

This is because a firm&apos;s cost of borrowing, or of using its own funds, decreases as the interest rate decreases. Higher interest rates discourage business spending. Firms find that lower interest rates give them more opportunities for profitable investment. If a firm has to pay 15 percent interest on its loans, it may find few profitable opportunities. If interest rates fall to 6 percent, however, the firm may find that some opportunities become profitable. If the macroeconomy is experiencing a contraction&ndash;declining income&ndash;the Federal Reserve may try to stimulate, or expand, it. The Fed will follow an easy money policy. That is, it will increase the money supply. An increased money supply will lower interest rates, thus encouraging investment spending. Of course, such a policy comes with some risk. For example, it may encourage overborrowing and overinvestment, followed by layoffs and cutbacks. If the economy is experiencing a rapid expansion that may cause high inflation, the Fed may introduce a tight money policy. That is, it will reduce the money supply. The Fed reduces the money supply to push interest rates upward. By raising interest rates, the Fed causes investment spending to decline. This brings real GDP down, too. Even though it can only alter the money supply, the Fed can have a great impact on the economy. The money supply influences interest rates, and interest rates influence the level of aggregate demand. Recall that aggregate demand represents the relationship between price levels and quantity demanded in the overall economy. Thus, the level of aggregate demand helps determine the level of real GDP.

Analyze Graphs Which scenario shown in these graphs represents the least stable economy? smooth out those fluctuations&ndash;in other words, to make the peaks a little bit lower and the troughs not quite so deep. This will minimize inflation in the peaks and the effects of recessions in the troughs. Properly timed stabilization policy smooths out the business cycle, as shown by the orange curve. The Results of Bad Timing If stabilization policy is not timed properly, however, it can actually make the business cycle more extreme, not smoother. The orange line in Graph B in Figure 9.28 shows the result of a poorly timed monetary policy, producing higher peaks and lower valleys than might otherwise occur. This can happen if, as GDP begins to fall from its peak, government economists fail to recognize that a contraction is occurring until the economy is already deeply into it. By the time they enact expansionary policies and have those policies take effect, the economy might already be coming out of the recession on its own. In such a situation, the expansionary effects of an easy money policy would boost the economy while it is already expanding. This could result in a larger expansion&ndash;but also very high inflation. Being late in implementing expansionary policies can have other effects, too. Suppose, for example, the economy has slowed down so much that businesses are reluctant to borrow at any rate for new investment. In that case, easy money would have little effect. As you can see, properly timing monetary policy is important. It is also difficult. Figure 9.29 shows some of many indicators economists study in their effort to understand the economy. There are two basic problems in the timing of any macroeconomic policy. These are called policy lags. Inside Lags The inside lag is the time it takes to implement monetary policy. Such lags, or delays, occur for two reasons. First, it takes time to identify a problem. Although economists have developed sophisticated computer models for predicting economic trends, they still cannot know for sure that the economy is headed into a new phase of the business cycle until it is already there. Statistics may conflict, and it can take up to a year to recognize a serious economic downturn. A second reason for inside lags is that once a problem has been recognized, it can take additional time to enact policies. This problem is more severe for fiscal policy than for monetary policy. Fiscal policy, which includes changes in government spending and taxation, requires actions by Congress and the President. Since Congress must debate new plans and get the approval of the President, it takes time to get a new policy enacted. The enactment of monetary policy, on the other hand, is streamlined. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times per year to discuss monetary policy&ndash; more often if necessary. Once it has decided that 9.5 The Effects of Monetary Policy 415 ]]></text>

Outside Lags Once a new policy is determined, it takes time to become effective. This time period, known as the outside lag, also differs for monetary and fiscal policy. For fiscal policy, the outside lag lasts as long as is required for new government spending or tax policies to take effect and to begin to affect real GDP and the inflation rate. This time period can be relatively short, as with a tax rebate that returns government revenues to households eager for spending money. One statistical model concluded that an increase in government spending would increase GDP after just six months. Outside lags can be much longer for monetary policy, since they primarily affect business investment plans. Firms may require months or even years to make large investment plans, especially those involving new physical capital, such as a new factory. Thus, a change in interest rates may not have its full effect on investment spending for several years. This conclusion is supported by several studies that suggest that more than two years may pass before the maximum impact of monetary policy is felt. Given the longer inside lag for fiscal policy and the longer outside lag for monetary policy, it is difficult to know which policy has the shorter total lag. In practice, partisan politics and budgetary pressures often prevent the President and Congress from agreeing on fiscal policy. Because of the political difficulties of implementing fiscal policy, we rely to a greater extent on the Fed to use monetary policy to soften the business cycle. APPLy CONCEPTS What problem can result from expansionary monetary policy that takes effect after the economy has already begun to expand following a period of contraction? Anticipating Business Cycles The Federal Reserve must do more than react to current trends. It must also anticipate changes in the economy.

Analyze Information What is the longest interval between recessions shown? Bounce to Activate Gallery inflation. This is the chief danger of using an easy money policy to get the economy out of a recession. An inflationary economy can be tamed by a tight money policy, but the timing is again crucial. If the policy takes effect as the economy is already cooling off on its own, the tight money could turn a mild contraction into a full-blown recession. The decision of whether to use monetary policy, then, must be based partly on expectations of the business cycle. Some recessions are mild and likely to end quickly even without any policy intervention. The same is true of some periods of inflation. Given the timing problems of monetary policy, it may be wiser in some cases to allow the business cycle to correct itself rather than run the risk of an ill-timed policy change. If a recession is expected to turn into an expansion in a short time, the best course of action may be to let the economy correct itself. On the other hand, if we expect a recession to last several years, then most economists would recommend an active policy. So, the question most policymakers face is this: How long will this recessionary (or inflationary) period last? How Quickly Do Economies Self-Correct? Economists disagree on the answer to this question. Their estimates for the U.S. economy range from two to six years. Figure 9.30 shows the timing and duration of the recessions in recent U.S. history. Since the economy may take quite a long time to recover on its own from an inflationary peak or a recessionary trough, policymakers have time to help the economy return to stable levels of output and prices. ANALyzE INfORMATION How would the Fed most likely respond if it predicted that a recession would soon turn into an expansion? Debating Monetary Policy In practice, the lags discussed here make monetary and fiscal policy difficult to apply. The lags and the general complexity of the national economy also make it difficult to sort out how different policies have affected the economy in the past. Economists have debated these matters for many years. Some economists believe that governments should emphasize fiscal policy more than monetary policy. These economists are in the tradition of John Maynard Keynes. According to them, government spending should be used to smooth out the peaks and valleys of the business cycle. Other economists are more in tune with the ideas of Milton Friedman. That is, they have greater faith in monetary policy. These proponents 9.5 The Effects of Monetary Policy 417 ]]></text>

Other economists, such as Friedrich Hayek, have taken different views. Hayek questioned economists&apos; ability to influence the economy effectively and had faith in a free economy&apos;s ability to self-adjust. Though Hayek died in 1992, his ideas continue to exert a strong influence. Like-minded economists today will usually recommend against enacting new policies, arguing that government intervention disrupts the proper functioning of a free market economy. This debate over which approach to take with monetary policy will probably never be settled to the satisfaction of all economists.

    <page pageNumber="485"> <text><![CDATA[ Primary Sources LAFS.1112.SL.1.3 The Role of Monetary Pollicy: Milton friedman Milton Friedman was one of the leading economists of the 20th century. He disagreed with Keynes&apos;s belief in government intervention in the economy. In this 1968 speech to the annual convention of American economists, he presents his point of view on monetary policy, or the role of the Federal Reserve System in regulating the money supply. There is wide agreement about the major goals of economic policy: high employment, stable prices, and rapid growth. There is less agreement that these goals are mutually compatible . . . There is least agreement about the role that various instruments of policy can and should play in achieving the several goals. My topic for tonight is the role of one such instrument&ndash;monetary policy. What can it contribute? And how should it be conducted to contribute the most? . . . In the first flush of enthusiasm about the newly created Federal Reserve System, many observers attributed the relative stability of the 1920s to the System&apos;s capacity for fine tuning . . . The Great Contraction destroyed this naive attitude. Opinion swung to the other extreme. Monetary policy was a string. You could pull on it to stop inflation but you could not push on it to halt recession. You could lead a horse to water but you could not make him drink. . . . dETERMINE MEANINg By raising interest rates, monetary policy discourages borrowing. By lowering interest rates, monetary policy encourages borrowing. What do you think Friedman means when he says “You could lead a horse to water but you could not make him drink”? Keynes offered simultaneously an explanation for the presumed impotence of monetary policy to stem the depression, a nonmonetary interpretation of the depression, and an alternative . . . &ndash;fiscal policy [policy on the government&apos;s budget]. Government spending could make up for insufficient private investment. Tax reductions could undermine stubborn thriftiness. . . . These views produced a widespread adoption of cheap money policies after the war. And they received a rude shock when these policies failed in country after country. . . Inflation, stimulated by cheap money policies . . . turned out to be the order of the day. The result was the beginning of a revival of belief in the potency [power] of monetary policy. . . . dETERMINE MEANINg What does Friedman mean by “cheap money”? The revival of belief in the potency of monetary policy was fostered also by a re-evaluation of the role money played from 1929 to 1933. Keynes . . . believed that the Great Contraction in the United States occurred despite aggressive expansionary policies by the monetary authorities&ndash;that they did their best but their best was not good enough. Recent studies have demonstrated that . . . the U.S. monetary authorities followed highly deflationary policies. . . .

    <page pageNumber="486"> <text><![CDATA[ Primary Sources Contraction is tragic testimony to the power of monetary policy&ndash;not, as Keynes and so many of his contemporaries believed, evidence of its impotence [powerlessness]. . . . I. What Monetary Policy Cannot Do From the infinite world of negation, I have selected two limitations of monetary policy to discuss: (1) It cannot peg interest rates for more than very limited periods; (2) It cannot peg the rate of unemployment for more than very limited periods . . . II. What Monetary Policy Can Do Monetary policy cannot peg these real magnitudes . . . But monetary policy can and does have important effects on these real magnitudes. The one is in no way inconsistent with the other. The first and most important lesson that history teaches about what monetary policy can do . . . is that monetary policy can prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance. . . . A second thing monetary policy can do is provide a stable background for the economy&ndash;keep the machine well oiled . . . Our economic system will work best when producers and consumers, employers and employees, can proceed with full confidence that the average level of prices will behave in a known way in the future&ndash;preferably that it will be highly stable. . . . Finally, monetary policy can contribute to offsetting major disturbances in the economic system arising from other sources. If there is [a too-rapid expansion of investment,] monetary policy can . . . help to hold it in check by a slower rate of monetary growth than would otherwise be desirable. If, as now, an explosive federal budget threatens unprecedented deficits, monetary policy can hold any inflationary dangers in check by a slower rate of monetary growth than would otherwise be desirable. . . . dETERMINE AUThOR&apos;S POINT Of VIEw Which monetary policy tool does Friedman seem to prefer: raising interest rates or lowering interest rates? III. How Should Monetary Policy Be Conducted? The first requirement is that the monetary authority should guide itself by magnitudes that it can control, not by ones that it cannot control. If, as the authority has often done, it takes interest rates or the current unemployment percentage as the immediate criterion of policy, it will be like a space vehicle that has taken a fix on the wrong star. . . . A second requirement for monetary policy is that the monetary authority avoid sharp swings in policy. . . . By setting itself a steady course and keeping to it, the monetary authority could make a major contribution to promoting economic stability. . . . That is the most that we can ask from monetary policy at our present stage of knowledge. But that much&ndash;and it is a great deal&ndash;is clearly within our reach. ASSESSMENT 1. Identify Cause and Effect What does Friedman suggest results from trying to use monetary policy to reduce unemployment? 2.

Lesson 1: The Federal Budget and Fiscal Policy ELD.K12.ELL.SI.1, SS.912.E.1.10 Fiscal policy is the use of taxes and government spending to influence the economy. The basic tool of fiscal policy is the federal budget, which lists income and planned spending. The federal budget requires approval by Congress and the President. Expansionary fiscal policy aims to increase output by raising spending, cutting taxes, or both. Contractionary policy aims to decrease output by cutting spending, raising taxes, or both. Issues such as the fixed amount of entitlements, political conflicts and difficulty forecasting the economy also make effective fiscal policy difficult. Lesson 2: Fiscal Policy Options LAFS.1112.WHST.3.9, SS.912.E.1.10 Classical economics holds that, since free markets regulate themselves, there is little reason for fiscal policy. Keynesian economics argues for fiscal policy to increase or decrease demand, making use of the multiplier effect, where every dollar of government spending translates into several dollars spent in the economy. Supply-side economics focuses instead on stimulating supply by cutting taxes. The U.S. government has followed both approaches at different times. Lesson 3: The National Debt and Deficits LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.2.9 When the government spends less than it receives in taxes, there is a budget surplus. When it spends more than it receives, there is a budget deficit. The government finances deficits by borrowing money, generally by selling bonds. Deficits contribute to the national debt. Government debt carries risks. Policymakers have sought to reduce the national debt, but terrorism and financial crisis caused the debt to rise again during the 2000s. Lesson 4: Monetary Policy Options LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.1.11 Banks create money by lending it into existence. A multiplier effect increases the money supply by a multiple of the original loan. The Fed uses three main monetary policy tools to increase or decrease the money supply. The Fed can raise or lower the minimum reserve banks are required to keep. It can adjust the interest rate it charges banks. It can also use open market operations to buy or sell bonds on the market, thereby pushing interest rates down or up and enlarging or reducing the money supply. Open market operations are the main tool the Fed uses today. Lesson 5: The Effects of Monetary Policy SS.912.E.1.11, SS.912.E.3.6 Increasing the supply of money lowers its price, or interest rate. Lower interest rates encourage borrowing, investment, spending, and economic expansion. If the economy faces overexpansion or inflation, the Fed can push interest rates up to decrease the money supply. Because monetary policy changes have a delayed effect, timing those changes is difficult. Fed policymakers try to anticipate business cycles. Economists differ on whether fiscal policy or monetary policy is a better tool. ]]></text>

The federal government applied monetary policy tools. DOCUMENT A This timeline highlights key steps in the government&apos;s response to the beginnings of the Great Recession. September 2007 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowers federal funds fate to 4.75%. March 2008 Federal Reserve offers up to $200 billion in loans to financial institutions. October 2008 Bush signs law creating $700 billion fund to help financial institutions. December 2008 FOMC says federal funds rate will be 0-0.25% until further notice. February 2008 President Bush signs Economic Stimulus Act, giving tax rebates and breaks to many. January 2008 FOMC lowers federal funds rate to 3%. April 2008 FOMC lowers federal funds rate to 2%. February 2009 President Obama signs Recovery and Reinvestment Act, with $787 billion in federal spending. DOCUMENT B In 2008, President George W. Bush signed the Economic Stimulus Act into law with this statement. The bill I&apos;m signing today is large enough to have an impact&ndash;amounting to more than $152 billion this year, or about 1 percent of GDP. The bill provides temporary tax incentives for businesses to make investments in their companies so that we create new jobs this year. The bill provides individual tax relief in the form of tax rebates. These rebates will amount to as much as $600 for individuals and $1,200 for married couples, with additional rebates for families with children. &ndash;President George W. Bush, February 13, 2008 DOCUMENT C One of the most controversial federal actions was passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a bailout plan for financial institutions. This editorial in a noted news magazine supported TARP. The economics behind this is sound. Government support to the banking system can break the cycle of panic and pessimism that threatens to suck the economy into deep recession. Intervention may help taxpayers, because they are also employees and consumers. Although $700 billion is a lot&ndash;about 6% of GDP&ndash;some of it will be earned back and it is small compared with the 16% of GDP that banking crises typically swallow . . . &ndash;The Economist, September 25, 2008 DOCUMENT D This attack on TARP came from an organization that opposes government interference in the economy. The TARP was crooked from the very start, using taxpayer funds to bail out some of the world&apos;s richest people from their own foolish investments. The claims that it made taxpayers money are unfounded. Even worse, TARP taught investment bankers an important lesson: During a boom, make as much money as you can, no matter how short-term the profits will be. When the bubble pops, the Treasury and Fed will be there with a taxpayer-funded pillow. &ndash;Robert P. Murphy, “Was TARP Good for the Taxpayers?” Ludwig Van Mises Institute, October 7, 2010 22. According to Document A, what type of government intervention in the economy did the actions in 2007 by the FOMC represent? A. tax policy B. business regulation C. monetary policy D. fiscal policy 23. Based on Document B, what steps did the Bush Administration support for stimulating the economy and providing jobs? A. raising taxes B. doing away with Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac C. supporting massive new government spending D. providing tax incentives and rebates 24. Which document most clearly supports the idea that government action during the recession mainly benefited the wealthy? A. Document A B. Document B C. Document C D. Document D 25. Writing Task In a brief essay, contrast points of view on federal government responses to the Great Recession. Assess the authors&apos; claims, reasoning, and evidence.

By looking at two odd products&ndash;birdhouses and T-shirts&ndash;you can better understand why nations trade. As you learned earlier, the resources that are used to make goods and services are called the factors of production. They include land (natural resources), labor, and capital (both physical and human). Because these resources are scarce, countries have to choose how to use their factors of production to produce particular goods. Because they cannot produce all goods with their scarce resources, they need to obtain those they do not produce somehow. Trade is how countries obtain those goods they do not produce. Natural Resources Natural resources, along with climate and geographic location, help determine what goods and services an economy produces. Fertile soil and a good growing climate allowed the central United States to develop an economy based on agriculture.

Physical capital includes the things that people make in order to produce final goods and services. Machinery, tractors, computers, and factories are examples of physical capital, as are the transportation and communication networks that allow the flow of goods and information. Capital also includes the money needed to invest in businesses and use natural resources. Human capital differs from labor. Labor refers to the size of a nation&apos;s workforce. Human capital is the knowledge and skills a worker gains through education and experience. Every job requires human capital. A surgeon must learn anatomy and how to use a scalpel. A taxi driver must memorize the layout of a city&apos;s streets. One way to measure a nation&apos;s human capital is to look at the general educational level of the populace. A country whose citizens have more schooling than those of another country has more human capital. Unequal Resource Distribution As Figure 10.1 shows, the availability of resources differs greatly Resource Distribution from one country to another. For example, Nigeria has less than three quarters the land area of Peru but more than ten times the arable land and six times the population. This suggests that Nigeria has more human capital and land that can be farmed than Peru does. A nation&apos;s ability to exploit, or use, its physical resources is affected by culture and history. For example, prolonged warfare may severely damage a nation&apos;s farms, forests, and transportation systems. History and culture affect human resources as well. In colonial America, a labor shortage led to the establishment of slavery. Today, a culture that bans education of women wastes much of its potential human capital. Specialization and Trade Unequal distribution of resources creates a need for specialization. (As you have read, specialization occurs when individuals, businesses, or nations produce only certain goods and services.) In the United States, we grow wheat, corn, and other crops for which we have suitable soil and climate conditions. However, we cannot grow large quantities of coffee or bananas. When nations specialize in certain goods, they obtain the goods they do not or cannot produce through importing and exporting. An export is a good or service sent to another country for sale.

    <page pageNumber="498"> <text><![CDATA[ An import is a good or service brought in from another country for sale. For example, Costa Rica specializes in growing and exporting coffee. The nation uses the money earned from selling coffee to import goods that it does not produce. In some cases, more than 70 percent of a nation&apos;s export trade depends upon a single resource. Examples include Kuwait (petroleum and natural gas), Guinea-Bissau (cashews), and the Marshall Islands (fish). SUMMARIzE Why are scarcity and choice basic economic problems faced by every country? Absolute and Comparative Advantage Suppose a nation enjoys an abundance of resources, including a rich natural environment, an educated workforce, and the latest technologies. In theory, such a nation could be self-sufficient, producing almost all that it needs by itself. Why, then, would it choose to engage in foreign trade? Although self-sufficiency may sound appealing, it is actually better for countries to specialize in some products and trade for others. To see why, you need to look at two related concepts&ndash;absolute advantage and comparative advantage. A person or nation has an absolute advantage when it can produce more of a given product than another person or nation using a given amount of resources. Explaining Absolute Advantage A simple example can illustrate the idea of absolute advantage. Suppose that two people, Jenny and Productivity and Opportunity Cost CARLOS JENNY T-shirts per hour Birdhouses per hour Opportunity cost of one birdhouse Opportunity cost of one T-shirt 6 2 3 T-shirts birdhouse13 1 1 1 T-shirt 1 birdhouse >> Figure 10.2 Analyze Charts How many T-shirts can Carlos make in the time it takes Jenny to make five T-shirts? Carlos, work at making both birdhouses and printed T-shirts. In one hour, Carlos can either print six T-shirts or make two birdhouses. (See Figure 10.2.) Jenny can print one T-shirt or make one birdhouse per hour. In other words, Carlos is more productive than Jenny in making both T-shirts and birdhouses. In economic terms, Carlos has an absolute advantage over Jenny in producing both goods. Because Carlos enjoys an absolute advantage in both goods, should he remain self-sufficient? Or would he be better off specializing in either T-shirts or birdhouses? What about Jenny? Should she make T-shirts, birdhouses, or both? Countries have to face the same sorts of questions. Should a wealthy country with many resources be self-sufficient, or should it specialize in producing a few products and trade for the others? How does a poorer nation decide what to produce? The answers to these questions lie with the concept of comparative advantage. Explaining Comparative Advantage Early in the nineteenth century, British economist David Ricardo argued that the key to determining which country should produce which goods is opportunity cost. Remember that opportunity cost is what you give up in order to produce a certain product. A country has a comparative advantage in the product that it can produce most efficiently given all the products it could choose to produce. It is the nation with the comparative advantage&ndash;not necessarily the one with the absolute advantage&ndash; that should specialize in producing that good. According to the law of comparative advantage, a nation is better off when it produces goods and services for which it has a comparative advantage. Each nation can then use the money it earns selling those goods and services to buy those that it cannot produce as efficiently. Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage To see how comparative advantage works, look again at Figure 10.2. It shows the opportunity costs of producing T-shirts and birdhouses for both Carlos and Jenny. &bull; Carlos&apos;s opportunity costs In an hour, Carlos can make either six T-shirts or two birdhouses. He therefore sacrifices three T-shirts for every birdhouse he produces. In terms of opportunity cost, the opportunity cost of a birdhouse is the three T-shirts he could have produced instead. The opportunity cost of a T-shirt is one third of a birdhouse. 432 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>

To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labor of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the same country, might require the labor of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth . . . notwithstanding that the commodity imported by Portugal could be produced there with less labor than in England.” David Ricardo,1817 “England may be so circumstanced, that to produce the cloth may require the labor of 100 men for one year; and if she attempted to make the wine, it might require the labor of 120 men for the same time. DAVID RICARDO COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE ON England would therefore find it in her interest to import wine, and to purchase it by the exportation of cloth. To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labor of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the same country, might require the labor of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth . . . notwithstanding that the commodity imported by Portugal could be produced there with less labor than in England.” David Ricardo,1817 “England may be so circumstanced, that to produce the cloth may require the labor of 100 men for one year; and if she attempted to make the wine, it might require the labor of 120 men for the same time. DAVID RICARDO COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE ON >> Analyze Information Why does Ricardo think Portugal should import cloth from England and produce wine rather than producing both? &bull; Jenny&apos;s opportunity costs In an hour, Jenny can make either one T-shirt or one birdhouse. Therefore, her opportunity cost for one birdhouse is one T-shirt, and her opportunity cost for one T-shirt is one birdhouse. According to the law of comparative advantage, each person should produce the good for which he or she has a lower opportunity cost than other producers. Carlos&apos;s opportunity cost for producing a T-shirt (one third of a birdhouse) is lower than Jenny&apos;s (one birdhouse), so it is sensible for Carlos to produce T-shirts. Jenny&apos;s opportunity cost for producing a birdhouse (one T-shirt) is lower than Carlos&apos;s (three T-shirts), so Jenny should produce birdhouses. The Mutual Benefits of Specialization If Carlos wants a birdhouse, he can either make it himself or make T-shirts and trade some of them to Jenny for a birdhouse. Suppose Carlos and Jenny agree to trade two T-shirts for one birdhouse. In this case, Carlos is clearly better off producing T-shirts and trading for a birdhouse. After all, in the time he would have used to make his own birdhouse, he can make three T-shirts. Since he pays Jenny only two T-shirts for a birdhouse, he has a T-shirt left over. Trade makes Carlos better off by one T-shirt. Jenny is also better off as a result of trade. She can make two birdhouses in the time she would need to produce two T-shirts for herself. Since she only pays one birdhouse to Carlos for the two T-shirts, she will still have one birdhouse left over. Trade makes her better off by one birdhouse. Carlos and Jenny both benefit from trade. Each person specializes in producing the good for which he or she has a comparative advantage. Since both producers are operating at greater efficiency, more total goods are produced overall. After the trade, each of them is left with an extra unit of the good originally produced, which can be used to trade for other goods. APPLy CONCEPTS How is opportunity cost related to comparative advantage? Comparative Advantage and World Trade The lessons from the example of Carlos and Jenny also apply to trade between nations. As you read, David Ricardo argued that the nation having the lower opportunity cost in producing a good has a comparative advantage in producing that good.

It carries out that trade by shipping its goods to other countries and allowing them to ship goods to it. Comparative Advantage in Action Suppose two countries, A and B, are capable of producing both bananas and sugar. However, Country A&apos;s climate and land are somewhat more suitable for growing bananas. For Country A, the opportunity cost of a ton of bananas is two tons of sugar. For Country B, the opportunity cost of a ton of bananas is three tons of sugar. Since Country A has a lower opportunity cost than does Country B, Country A has a comparative advantage in producing bananas. It should therefore specialize in growing bananas and exporting them to the world market. Trade allows countries to obtain goods for which they might have a high opportunity cost. Thus, Country A can use the money it earns from exporting bananas to import other goods and services that it cannot produce for itself as efficiently as other countries. If a country focuses its resources on producing certain goods, it can make more of >> Cities, as well as countries, produce goods in which they have a comparative advantage. The skilled weavers in Cuenca, Ecuador, make Panama hats that sell for hundreds of dollars overseas. them. This is one way that trade causes economic growth. Growing Interdependence The growth of international trade has led to greater economic interdependence among nations. Interdependence is the shared need of countries for the resources, goods, services, labor, and knowledge supplied by other countries. Because countries are interdependent, changes in one country&apos;s economy influence other economies. For example, a drought in Brazil would hurt that country&apos;s coffee growers. Coffee growers in Costa Rica or Colombia may benefit, though, because they would be able to sell more of their product on the world market. Another example of interdependence can be seen when one country experiences economic growth. Suppose that Mexico&apos;s economy grows, resulting in more jobs and higher wages for Mexican workers. With more income, these workers are likely to have greater demand for goods. By buying some of those goods from other countries, Mexico would be helping the economies of its trading partners to grow. IdENTIfy CENTRAL ISSUES How does comparative advantage explain why countries trade? The United States and Its Trading Partners The United States enjoys a comparative advantage in producing many goods and services. What, then, is its position as an importer and exporter, and what is the impact of that trade? The Impact of U.S. Exports The United States exports more goods than any other country except China. (The 28-nation European Union exports more than the United States, but less than China.) One reason is the wide range of its export products, from soybeans to telecommunications equipment. Another reason is that the United States excels in technologically sophisticated goods such as software, chemicals, and medical testing supplies. Goods make up the bulk of international trade, but the United States is also the world&apos;s leading exporter of services. These include education, computer and data processing, financial services, and medical care. Exports of services have grown rapidly in recent decades. U.S. cultural exports such as movies, television shows, and popular music have an economic impact. American movies 434 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>

Bounce to Activate Map capture about two thirds of ticket sales in Western Europe, creating difficulties for domestic production companies. These pop culture exports also have a cultural impact. They can convey particular images of the American lifestyle and values, introducing new ideas to people of other cultures. The leading trading partners for U.S. exports are Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan. Nearly half of all exports are capital goods&ndash;transistors, aircraft, motor vehicle parts, computers, and telecommunications equipment. Another quarter are industrial supplies, with the remainder coming from consumer goods and agricultural products. Sometimes these exports provide goods that the country could not produce on its own. Sometimes, though, U.S. products compete with locally produced goods, and low-cost U.S. products have an impact on local suppliers. For instance, U.S. exports of corn to Mexico have surged in recent years. Competition from these products has cut the income of as many as 3 million Mexican farmers, according to some estimates. The Impact of U.S. Imports The United States is also the world&apos;s top importing country&ndash;by a significant amount. U.S. imports total nearly $2.3 trillion, $600 billion more than China, the next biggest importer. Where do most goods imported into the United States come from? As you might expect, Canada and Mexico provide a significant share of U.S. imports. These neighbors and trading partners have a significant impact on the U.S. economy, literally helping to fuel it. Canada and Mexico are the second and third leading suppliers of energy to the United States, after Saudi Arabia. While Canada and Mexico account for a quarter of U.S. imports, China has become the leading source of U.S. imports. Chinese imports give consumers access to goods they want at lower prices than they would have to pay if made in the United States or imported from another source. Rising U.S. imports from China have also helped fuel China&apos;s economic growth. CONNECT What impact do you think the United States has had on China&apos;s manufacturing sector? Why? The Impact of Trade on Jobs Trade allows nations to specialize in producing a limited number of goods while consuming a greater variety of goods. However, specialization can also dramatically affect a nation&apos;s employment patterns. Specialization and Job Loss To help you better understand the effects of international trade on employment, think back to the example of Carlos and Jenny.

He later realizes that he should specialize only in T-shirts since that is where his comparative advantage lies. Since he no longer needs Amy to help him make birdhouses, he fires her. Up to this point, Amy has specialized in the skills needed to make birdhouses. These skills are no longer in demand where she lives. &bull; Amy can gain new job skills that are more in demand.

Trade and Employment in the United States Carlos&apos;s decision to focus on his comparative advantage and specialize in making T-shirts had an impact on Amy&apos;s economic well-being. In the same way, the comparative advantage of nations affects the economic well-being of workers living in those nations. International trade has led to significant changes in U.S. employment patterns. During the 1970s, for example, high worker productivity and new technologies like robotics helped give Japan a comparative advantage in making automobiles. American car companies lost business. Falling sales led them to reduce their workforce, costing many American autoworkers their jobs. Businesses and government often provide help to retrain laid-off workers or assist them in relocating. In some cases, however, retraining or relocation is not possible. Some workers may be forced to take lower-paying jobs or face prolonged unemployment. Trade can also result in the creation of new jobs. If American exports grow, there will be more demand for workers to make those products.

See Figure 2.10 for a model of these flows. Now that you have learned how financial institutions function and how international trade affects the economy, you will see how a circular flow model for an open-market economy can show flows between households, firms, government, financial institutions, and product and factor markets. The model can also show flows between domestic and international firms through international trade. Financial Institutions and the Circular Flow As you have learned, financial institutions operate mainly in the factor market for capital. Financial institutions take in savings from households, government and firms. Financial institutions put these savings to work in the form of investments in firms and lending to households and governments. Figure 10.4 shows the flows of savings to financial institutions in purple and investments by financial institutions in black. International Trade and the Circular Flow The circular flow of products and factors also includes international trade. Exports are products that move from firms in this country to foreign firms and households. Imports are products that move from foreign firms to firms in this country, and from them to households. Foreign firms and households also send savings to financial institutions. In turn, financial institutions put those savings to work in the form of investments in foreign firms and lending to foreign households. Figure 10.4 also shows these flows. In fact, international trade helps to increase the flow of goods and factors through a country&apos;s markets. It does this by increasing the size of the market in which that country&apos;s firms and households can participate and through the principle of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage increases these flows by enlarging markets for goods and services in which a country&apos;s firms have a comparative advantage and by creating savings when that country imports goods and services in which another country has a comparative advantage. dRAW INfERENCES How do financial institutions promote international trade, according to the circular flow model?

To understand why, you need to understand the kinds of barriers that nations sometimes erect to trade. In this section, you will also see how trade policies may affect what you pay for dozens of products, from chocolate to cars. A trade barrier, or trade restriction, is a means of preventing a foreign product or service from freely entering a nation&apos;s territory. Trade barriers take several forms and may be used for various purposes. Tariffs One common trade barrier is a tariff, or a tax on imported goods. Until the early 1900s, tariffs were a major tool of fiscal policy in the United States and the main source of revenue for the federal government. As you can see from Figure 10.5, however, tariffs today are much lower. Still, the United States continues to collect tariffs on steel, foreign-made cars, and many other products. If you have traveled abroad, you may have had to pay a tax on foreign goods you brought back to the United States. These customs duties are another form of tariff.

   </page>
    <page pageNumber="505"> <text><![CDATA[ Quotas and VERs Another kind of barrier is an import quota. Import quotas place a limit on the amount of a good that can be imported. For example, the United States limits the annual amount of raw cotton coming into the country from other nations. Many import quotas are now illegal under international trade laws. Tariffs and quotas are laws set by the importing country. By contrast, a voluntary export restraint (VER) is a voluntary limit set by the exporting country, restricting the quantity of a product it will sell to another country. A nation that adopts a VER seeks to reduce the risk that the importing country will impose damaging trade barriers itself. Other Barriers to Trade Other government actions may also create trade barriers. For example, a government may require foreign companies to obtain a license to sell goods in that country. High licensing fees and slow licensing processes act as informal trade barriers. Health, safety, or environmental regulations can also act as trade barriers. Suppose a nation treats the fruit it grows with a particular insecticide. Another nation might ban any fruit treated with that insecticide in order to discourage imports of foreign fruit. The U.S. antipollution standard that requires cars to be equipped with catalytic converters is another example. Cars that do not meet this requirement cannot be exported to the United States. Average Tariff Rates, 1900–2010 Finally, a nation may impose trade barriers and other economic sanctions for political reasons. Sanctions are actions a nation or group of nations takes in order to punish or put pressure on another nation. For example, in the 1960s, the United States banned all trade with Cuba. The purpose of this trade embargo was to cause economic strain that might weaken Cuba&apos;s communist dictatorship. An embargo is an official ban on trade or other commercial activity with a country. COMPARE ANd CONTRAST How are voluntary export restraints and import quotas different? Effects of Trade Barriers By limiting supply, trade barriers can have very different effects on domestic producers and consumers. Trade barriers may also create tense relations between importing and exporting countries. Higher Prices for Foreign Goods Trade barriers can help domestic producers compete with foreign firms. By limiting imports from those firms, or by making the prices of those imports higher, trade barriers give a competitive advantage to domestic companies. Although domestic producers may benefit, consumers can lose out. Restrictions on imports result in higher prices. For example, suppose the 60 0 10 20 30 40 50 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Rate(as a percentage of total imports) Year SOURCE: U.S. International Trade Commission 2010 >> Figure 10.5 Analyze Graphs Describe what has happened to tariff rates since 1950 versus the period from 1900 to 1950. 10.2 Trade Barriers and Agreements 439 ]]></text>

If the government places a 10-percent tariff on all imported foreign cars, the price of the average imported car would increase from $20,000 to $22,000. Consumers who bought such a vehicle would be paying a higher price than if there had been no tariff. Also, with foreign competition limited, domestic carmakers would have no incentive to keep prices low. Trade Wars Trade barriers may also fuel international conflict. When one country restricts imports, its trading partner may retaliate by placing its own restrictions on imports. If the first country responds with further trade limits, the result is a trade war, a cycle of escalating trade barriers. Trade wars often cause economic hardship for both sides. Probably the most damaging trade war in American history began during the Great Depression. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot- Hawley Act, raising average tariff rates on all imports to 50 percent. Congress hoped the tariff would protect American workers and businesses from foreign competition and help the economy rebound. The reverse effect took place, though. Other countries responded by raising tariffs on American-made goods. The resulting trade war decreased international trade and deepened the worldwide depression. Most economists blame the Smoot-Hawley tariff for increasing American unemployment. Trade wars still occur, but they usually involve a few products rather than all imports. In 2002, the United States placed temporary tariffs on imported steel to help American steelmakers recover from bankruptcy. European nations threatened to retaliate. This “steel war” ended when an international panel ruled that the tariffs were illegal. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT Why are trade wars harmful? Arguments for Protectionism Why does a nation impose trade barriers? One reason is protectionism, the use of trade barriers to shield domestic industries from foreign competition. Protectionists have generally used three main arguments to support their view: saving jobs, protecting infant industries, and safeguarding national security. Protecting Jobs One argument for protectionism is that it shelters workers in industries that may be hurt by foreign competition. Suppose that certain East Asian nations had a comparative advantage in producing textiles.

They would have to close their factories and lay off workers. Ideally, the laid-off workers would take new jobs in other industries. In practice, however, many of these workers would find retraining or relocation difficult. In addition, few industry or political leaders want to see existing industries shut down or large numbers of people lose their jobs. For this reason, public officials might favor protectionism to keep companies alive and people working. Protecting Infant Industries Another argument for protectionism is that industries in the early stages of development need time and experience to become efficient producers. Tariffs that raise the price of imported goods provide a period of time for these infant industries to become more competitive. Once that happens, the tariff can be eliminated. In the early years of the United States, Alexander Hamilton favored using tariffs to protect young American industries from European competition. Today, many developing nations adopt protectionist policies for similar reasons: Global economic competition is a game of unequal players.

In practice, this means allowing them to protect . . . their producers more vigorously. &ndash;Ha-Joon Chang, “Protecting the Global Poor” Three problems may arise with such protective tariffs, however. First, a protected infant industry may lack the incentive to “grow up,” that is, to become more efficient and competitive. Second, once an industry has been given tariff protection, lawmakers may find it difficult for political reasons to take the protections away.

For this reason, the government wants to ensure that such domestic industries remain active. Foes of trade barriers agree that protecting defense industries is important. They argue, however, that some industries that seek protection are not really essential to national security. SUPPORT A POINT Of VIEW WITh EVIdENCE What are the three arguments given for protectionism? Trade Agreements In opposition to protectionism is the principle of free trade. Free trade involves the lowering or elimination of protective tariffs and other trade barriers between two or more nations. Supporters argue that free trade is the best way to pursue comparative advantage, raise living standards, and further cooperative relationships among nations. To encourage free trade, a number of countries in recent decades have signed international free trade agreements. Some of these pacts involve dozens of nations. Nations form and join free trade zones because, according to the rules of comparative advantage, free trade will increase a nation&apos;s exports and lower prices for consumers on imported goods. Roots of Free Trade Today&apos;s free trade movement began in the 1930s. The Smoot-Hawley Act caused a rapid decline in international trade. To encourage trade, Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. It gave the president the power to reduce tariffs by as much as 50 percent. That law also allowed Congress to grant most- favored nation (MFN) status to U.S. trading partners. Today, MFN status is called normal trade relations status, or NTR. All countries with NTR status pay the same tariffs, though imports from non-NTR nations may be taxed at a higher rate. In 1948, after World War II had disrupted world trade, many nations reached an agreement called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Its goal was to reduce tariffs and stabilize world trade. World Trade Organization In 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) was founded with the goal of making global trade more free. The WTO works to ensure that countries comply with GATT, to negotiate new trade agreements, and to resolve trade disputes. Various conferences, or rounds, of tariff negotiations have advanced the goals of GATT and the WTO. For example, the Uruguay round of For Trade Barriers For Trade Agreements OPPOSING VIEWS ON TRADE &bull;Jobs: Trade barriers protect jobs from going to other countries &bull;Industries: Trade barriers protect domestic industries from competition &bull;Security: Trade barriers protect industries essential to national security &bull;Multinationals: Trade barriers limit the political power of multinationals in host nations &bull;Competition: Trade agreements allow and enhance competition &bull;Prices: Trade agreements lower prices for foreign goods &bull;Efficiency: Free trade is the best way to pursue comparative advantage &bull;Risk: Trade agreements lessen risk of trade wars >> Analyze Charts Using the chart, name one way trade barriers benefit workers and one way trade agreements benefit consumers. 442 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>

Today, the World Trade Organization also acts as a referee, enforcing the rules agreed upon by the member countries. WTO decisions resolved the beef war and the steel tariff disputes between the United States and the European Union. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT What effect does a free trade agreement have on the countries that sign it? Regional Trade Organizations In addition to the WTO, there are smaller regional trade organizations, often made up of several countries in the same general geographic area. These trade organizations seek to enhance free trade among member nations. The European Union In recent years, many countries have signed agreements to abolish tariffs and trade restrictions among member nations and adopt uniform tariffs for all countries that are not members. One example is the European Union (EU). The European Union developed slowly over several decades. In 1957, six western European nations set up the Common Market to coordinate economic and trade policies. In the years that followed, more countries joined the Common Market. In 1986, the member nations agreed to eliminate tariffs on one another&apos;s exports. They created a single market, called the European Economic Community (EEC). In 1993, the EEC nations formed the European Union. This new organization became the largest trading bloc in the world. By 2013, the EU included 28 countries&ndash;almost all of Europe. Some member nations signed the European Monetary Union, agreeing to adopt a single currency and monetary system. In 2002, 12 member nations replaced their individual currencies with a single currency called the euro. As of 2013, 18 countries used the euro. The EU also adopted political ties, forming a parliament and council that make laws all member nations must follow. Still, many Europeans feared such measures threatened each nation&apos;s right to make decisions in its own interest.

Bounce to Activate Map American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), created a free trade zone linking the United States, Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA aroused controversy in the United States. Opponents worried that American companies would move factories to Mexico, where wages were lower and environmental regulations were less strict. As a result, they said, American workers would lose jobs. Supporters of NAFTA claimed that the measure would instead create more jobs in the United States, because it would increase exports to Mexico and Canada. After a spirited debate, the Senate ratified NAFTA in 1993. Major provisions include: &bull; Elimination of tariffs on farm products &bull; Elimination of auto tariffs &bull; Truck access across borders &bull; Special judges to resolve trade disputes More than 20 years after it went into effect, the agreement has remained controversial. Many studies suggest that NAFTA has had its intended economic benefits. Yet, other studies suggest these benefits have come at a cost to U.S. workers. What is clear is that trade between the member nations has increased. U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has tripled since 1993. CAFTA-DR and FTAA In 2003, the United States government reached a free trade agreement with nations in Central America. At the time, the deal was called the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). The next year, when the Dominican Republic joined the pact, the name was changed to CAFTA-DR. Congress approved the agreement in July 2005, and the other nations formally approved it as well. Case Study: The FTAA After NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, the United States proposed extending many of its provisions to other countries in North and South America. The proposed free trade zone was called the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or FTAA. Negotiations began in 1998. Negotiations were scheduled for completion by January 2005 with a goal of implementing the FTAA by the end of 2005. However, negotiators failed to reach an agreement by this deadline. Brazil and Argentina, the leading members of the Mercosur trade union, objected to U.S. agricultural subsidies, which made it harder for crops from Mercosur countries to compete. Latin American countries were also unwilling to meet U.S. demands for intellectual 444 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>

These would have made it illegal to sell cheaper generic versions of patented drugs made by U.S. pharmaceutical firms in Latin American countries. Because it was impossible to resolve these disagreements, the United States gave up on the FTAA. Instead, the United States began seeking trade agreements with individual Latin American countries. Other Regional Trade Agreements About 100 regional trading organizations operate in the world today. They include the following: APEC The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is an economic forum that includes 21 countries along the Pacific Rim, including the United States. They have signed a nonbinding agreement to reduce trade barriers. MERCOSUR The Southern Common Market is similar to the EU in its goals. Its members are the South American nations of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, and Venezuela. CARICOM The Caribbean Community and Common Market includes countries from South America and the Caribbean. ASEAN The ten-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations has taken steps to establish a free trade zone similar to the EU. The Debate Over Free Trade While the world&apos;s economies have moved toward free trade, controversy on trade continues. Debates over the impact of NAFTA became a campaign issue in the American presidential election of 2008. As you saw, protests across the Americas slowed negotiations on the FTAA. Meetings of the World Trade Organization have also spurred large protests. A 1999 WTO meeting in Seattle, Washington, drew as many as 50,000 angry demonstrators. Not all of these protesters were opposed to free trade. Rather, they were concerned that current free trade agreements gave too much economic power to large multinational corporations. Support a Point of View Wit h Evi dence Why do you think NAFTA stirred such debate in the United States?

It may also benefit from cheaper labor. The host nation benefits by gaining jobs and tax revenue. Still, host nations worry about the effect of multinationals on their countries. In a small country with a fragile economy, multinationals can gain excessive political power. In addition, host nations fear that multinationals could drive out domestic industries and exploit local workers.

    <page pageNumber="514"> <text><![CDATA[ Exchange Rates Changing money from one nation&apos;s currency to another&apos;s is never a simple matter of exchanging, say, one yuan or one peso for one American dollar. A dollar might be worth 8 yuan or 11 pesos. The value of a nation&apos;s currency in relation to a foreign currency is called the exchange rate. Understanding how exchange rates work enables you to convert prices in one currency to prices in another currency. Daily exchange rates are listed in major newspapers and on the Internet. Figure 10.6 shows a sample table of exchange rates. If you read down the first column, you will see that one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for more than one (1.10) Australian dollar, for less than one (0.74) euro, and so forth. An exchange-rate table shows what one U.S. dollar is worth on one particular day. Remember, the rates change daily, so it is important to keep checking, especially if you are visiting a foreign country or doing business overseas. Converting Prices A simple formula allows you to convert the price of an item from foreign currency to American dollars. Just divide the price by the value of the currency per one dollar according to the exchange rate. Look at the following example: Suppose your family is planning a trip to Mexico and that the exchange rate is as shown in Figure 10.6. Foreign Exchange Rates If a hotel room in Mexico costs 500 pesos per night, the price in U.S. dollars is $38.20. 500 pesos ÷ 13.09 pesos/dollar = $38.20. Now suppose your family decides to go to Mexico next year instead, and the exchange rate has risen to 15.0 pesos per dollar. Assuming that the room rate is still 500 pesos, the hotel room will cost only $33.33 per night: 500 pesos ÷ 15.0 pesos/dollar = $33.33 Appreciating Currency You have probably heard newscasters talk about a “strong” or “weak” dollar or a currency like the Japanese yen “rising” or “falling.” What do these terms mean? Do they indicate good news or bad news for the United States economy? An increase in the value of a currency is called appreciation. When a currency appreciates, it becomes “stronger.” If the exchange rate between the dollar and the yen increases from 100 yen per dollar to 120 yen per dollar, each dollar can buy more yen. Since the dollar has increased in value, we say that the dollar has appreciated against the yen. This appreciation means that people in Japan will have to spend more yen to purchase a dollar&apos;s worth of goods from the United States. On the other hand, Americans who travel to Japan can buy more goods and services for the same amount of money than they could before the dollar appreciated.

Analyze Charts Which two currencies are the most frequently traded? Why do you think this is so? When a nation&apos;s currency appreciates, its products become more expensive in other countries. For example, a strong dollar makes American goods and services more expensive for Japanese consumers. Japan will therefore probably import fewer products from the United States. As a result, total United States exports to Japan will likely decline. On the other hand, a strong dollar makes foreign products less expensive for consumers in the United States. A strong dollar is therefore likely to lead consumers in the United States to purchase more imported goods. Depreciating Currency A decrease in the value of a currency is called depreciation. You might also hear depreciation referred to as “weakening.” If the dollar exchange rate fell to 80 yen per dollar, you would get fewer yen for each dollar. In other words, the dollar has depreciated against the yen. When a nation&apos;s currency depreciates, its products become cheaper to other nations. A depreciated, or weak, dollar means that foreign consumers will be able to better afford products made in the United States. A weakened dollar probably results in increased exports. At the same time, other nations&apos; products become more expensive for consumers in the United States, so they will buy fewer imports. Exchanging Currency Suppose that a company in the United States sells computers in Japan. That company is paid in yen. It must, however, pay its workers and suppliers back in the United States in dollars. The company must therefore exchange its yen for U.S. dollars. This exchange takes place on the foreign exchange market. International trade would not be possible without this market. The foreign exchange market consists of about 2,000 banks and other financial institutions that facilitate the buying and selling of foreign currencies. These banks are located in various financial centers around the world, including such cities as New York, London, Paris, Singapore, and Tokyo. These banks maintain close links to one another through telephones and computers. This technology allows for the instantaneous transmission of market information and rapid financial transactions.

    <page pageNumber="516"> <text><![CDATA[ Determining the Value of Currency As you read earlier, currencies varied in value from state to state in early America. In the United States today, of course, it doesn&apos;t matter which state you live in. All prices are in dollars, and all dollars have the same value. Think how much more complicated it would be to do business if each state still had its own currency. To buy goods from a mail-order company in Indiana, for instance, someone in Texas would have to find out the exchange rate between a Texas dollar and an Indiana dollar. The economy would become less efficient as individuals and businesses spent time keeping track of exchange rates. Such complications do not exist within the United States. They do, however, apply to international trade. Fixed Exchange-Rate Systems Of course, it would be simpler if all countries either used the same currency or kept their exchange rates constant. Then no one would have to worry about rate shifts. A system in which governments try to keep the values of their currencies constant against one another is called a fixed exchange-rate system. In a typical fixed exchange-rate system, one country with a stable currency is at the center. Other countries fix, or peg, their exchange rates to this currency. Normally, the fixed exchange-rate is not a single value, but is kept within a certain specified range (for example, plus or minus 2 percent). If the exchange rate moves outside of this range, governments usually intervene to maintain the rate. How do governments intervene to maintain an exchange rate? The exchange rate is essentially the price of a currency. Like the price of any product or service, the exchange rate relies on supply and demand. To preserve its exchange rate, a government may buy or sell foreign currency in order to affect a currency&apos;s supply and demand. It will follow this course of action until the exchange rate is back within the specified limits. The Bretton Woods Conference In 1944, as World War II was drawing to a close, representatives from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Their purpose was to make financial arrangements for the postwar world. The Bretton Woods conference resulted in the creation of a fixed exchange-rate system for the United States and much of western Europe. Because the United States had the strongest economy and most stable currency, conference participants agreed to peg their currencies to the United States dollar.

    <page pageNumber="517"> <text><![CDATA[ To make the new system work, the Bretton Woods conference established the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Today, the IMF promotes international monetary cooperation, currency stabilization, and trade. Flexible Exchange-Rate Systems Although fixed exchange-rate systems make trade easier, they depend on countries maintaining similar economic policies as well as similar inflation and interest rates. By the late 1960s, worldwide trade was growing and changing rapidly. At the same time, the war in Vietnam was causing inflation in the United States. These factors made it increasingly difficult for many countries to rely on a fixed exchange rate. In 1971, the Netherlands and West Germany abandoned the fixed exchange-rate system. Other countries followed. By 1973, even the United States had adopted a system based on flexible exchange rates. Under a flexible exchange-rate system, the exchange rate is determined by supply and demand rather than according to any preset range. Today, the countries of the world use a mixture of fixed and flexible exchange rates. Most major currencies&ndash;including the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen&ndash;use the flexible exchange-rate system. This system accounts for the day-to-day changes in currency values that you read about earlier in this section. When the current flexible exchange-rate system was first adopted, some economists worried that changes in the exchange rate might interrupt the flow of world trade. In actual fact, trade has grown rapidly since the flexible exchange-rate system was adopted. Today, more nations trade than ever before. The Euro Although the flexible exchange-rate system works well, some countries whose economies are closely tied together want the advantages of fixed rates. One way to enjoy the advantages but avoid some of the difficulties of fixed exchange rates is to abolish individual currencies and establish a single currency. This is what 11 countries of the European Union did by adopting the euro. Use of this common currency requires countries to coordinate their economic policies, but it also simplifies trade. People traveling from, say, Germany to France do not need to exchange marks for francs at the border. They simply use their euros. However, having one currency has had its disadvantages. During the financial crisis that started in 2007, a number of countries, including Greece, Spain, and Italy, faced >> Global leaders met at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, NH, to stabilize the world&apos;s financial system. They instituted policies that were designed to prevent practices that could lead to severe economic downturns. economic difficulties and became less competitive on world markets. Because they were part of the single currency block, they could not depreciate their own currency or use monetary policy to help alleviate their economic problems. Instead, they were forced to suffer through a deep and prolonged recession to reduce their wages and prices in order to restore their competitiveness. These adjustments not only caused economic strife for those countries, but also created tensions within the entire group of nations using the euro. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT Has the flexible exchange-rate system prevented or enabled an increase in world trade? Balance of Trade The value of a nation&apos;s currency is affected by the overall flow of goods and services into and out of the country. In turn, exchange rates can affect a nation&apos;s balance of trade, the relationship between the value of its exports and the value of its imports. 10.3 Exchange Rates and Trade 451 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="518"> <text><![CDATA[ Surpluses and Deficits The importing and exporting of goods and services can have a significant impact on the United States and its trading partners. A trade imbalance, which occurs when a large difference between a nation&apos;s imports and exports arises, is one example. A nation that exports more goods and services than it imports has a positive trade balance, or a trade surplus. A nation that imports more goods and services than it exports has a negative trade balance, or a trade deficit. Nations seek to maintain a balance of trade. That is, they hope the value of imports is roughly equal to the value of exports. By balancing trade, a nation can protect the value of its currency on the international market. When a country has a continuing negative balance of trade, importing more than it is exporting over an extended period of time, the value of its currency falls. For example, in the 1980s, the United States imported considerably more than it exported. As a result of this trade imbalance, the foreign exchange market was glutted with U.S. dollars. Because the supply of dollars was so high, the value of the dollar fell. The prices of imports increased, and American consumers had to pay more for imported goods. A negative balance of trade can be corrected either by limiting imports or by increasing the number or value of exports. Both of these actions affect trading partners, of course, who may then retaliate by raising tariffs. Maintaining a balance of trade thus requires international cooperation and fair trade practices. Balance of Payments and Circular Flow Model Balance of trade measures the flow of goods and services among nations. Economists get a more complex picture of international trade by looking at the balance of payments. Balance of payments is the value of all monetary transactions between all sectors of a country&apos;s economy&ndash;households, firms, and government&ndash;and the rest of the world. Recall the circular flow model of a mixed economy (Figure 10.4) that you saw earlier. It shows the movement of money and goods within a global economy.

Any returns from the investment would be part of the monetary flow coming into the country.

Analyze Graphs In which year was the trade deficit greatest? Bounce to Activate Chart A Growing Trade Deficit Although the United States sells many goods abroad, it generally imports more than it exports. As a result, the United States currently runs a trade deficit. (See Figure 10.7) Causes of the Trade Deficit The U.S. trade deficit began to take shape in the 1970s, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) dramatically raised the price of oil. The United States, which depends heavily on foreign oil, thus had to increase the money spent on this vital resource. As a result, the total cost of imports to the United States began to exceed the income from its exports. The United States suffered record trade deficits in 1986 and 1987. In the early 1990s, the trade deficit began to fall. By the late 1990s, however, the deficit had skyrocketed to record levels, largely as a result of a new increase in oil prices and an economic boom that fueled consumer buying of imported goods. In 2012, the trade deficit totaled over $530 billion, with the largest amounts owed to China, the European Union, Japan, Germany, Mexico, Canada, and oil exporting nations such as Venezuela. Energy imports, including petroleum, accounted for 40 percent of the deficit. Effects of the Trade Deficit When Americans import more than they export, more dollars end up in the hands of foreigners. They can then use these extra dollars to purchase American land, stocks, bonds, and other assets. As a result of America&apos;s trade deficits, people from other countries now own a large piece of the U.S. economy. Many people fear this trend threatens national independence and even national security. Some economists worry that foreign financial investment might not always support the trade deficit. They worry that, with U.S. imports on the rise and American foreign debt growing, overseas investors might become reluctant to purchase American assets. As a result, that monetary flow into the United States would slow down. In 2000, a federal commission formed to study the deficit concluded that “maintaining large and growing trade deficits is neither desirable nor likely to be sustainable for the extended future.” Can Balance of Trade Be Restored? To reduce the trade deficit, the government could depreciate the exchange rate. As you saw, when the dollar is weak, American products become cheaper to buy on the world market, and other countries&apos; goods become correspondingly more expensive. As a result, exports rise and imports fall. The head of the nation&apos;s largest steelmaker noted this process at work in 2008: 10.3 Exchange Rates and Trade 453 ]]></text>

In this Lesson, you will examine what some of these differences are and why they exist. Economists divide the world&apos;s nations into different categories according to their level of development. Development is the process by which a nation improves the economic, political, and social well-being of its people. It is important to remember that development refers to a nation&apos;s material well-being. It is not a judgment of the worth of a nation or its people. The level of development does not indicate cultural superiority or inferiority. It simply indicates how well a nation is able to feed, clothe, and shelter its people. Nations with a relatively high average of material well-being are called developed nations. The United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the nations of Western Europe fall into this category. Most nations, however, have relatively low levels of material well-being. These less developed countries (LDCs) include the world&apos;s poorest countries, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Albania, and nations of central and southern Africa.

    <page pageNumber="522"> <text><![CDATA[ One group of LDCs has made great progress toward developing their economies. These newly industrialized countries (NICs) include Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and several countries in Eastern Europe. Some NICs are rich in resources, especially oil. Saudi Arabia, for example, has made a great deal of money from selling oil and oil products. Others have turned to manufacturing. Although the NICs have pulled ahead of the poorer LDCs, they have yet to achieve the high standard of living of developed nations. CONTRAST How do NICs differ from both developed nations and LDCs? Indicators of Development Economists use many different factors to measure a nation&apos;s level of development. These economic indicators include production of goods and services, energy consumption, distribution of the workforce, availability of consumer goods, and social conditions. Per Capita GDP As you read earlier, gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a year. GDP alone, however, is not adequate to compare the living standards of nations. Instead, economists use per capita GDP, a nation&apos;s GDP divided by its population. As Figure 10.8 shows, per capita GDP can vary widely from nation to nation. Why is per capita GDP considered to be a more accurate measure of development than GDP by itself? Look at two nations, Spain and India. Both have high GDPs&ndash;about $1.32 trillion for Spain and about $1.84 trillion for India. Yet Spain enjoys a high standard of living, while India is relatively poor. The reason for this discrepancy is population size. Spain&apos;s $1.32 trillion is shared by more than 46.2 million people. Thus, its per capita GDP is around $28,751. India&apos;s $1.84 trillion is shared by about 1.2 billion people, so its per capita GDP is only around $1,530. These figures indicate that the average person in Spain is better off, in material terms, than the average person in India. Of course, per capita GDP does not take into account distribution of income. Within every nation, some people are wealthier than most, while others are poorer than most. In many LDCs, the gap between rich and poor is especially wide. The World Bank, an international economic organization that studies development, uses a similar measure called per capita gross national income (GNI).

Energy Use Energy use is another good way to measure development. The amount of energy that a nation consumes is closely linked to its level of industrialization. Industrialization is the organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacture. Because industrial processes generally require large amounts of energy, high levels of energy use tend to indicate high levels of industrial activity. They also indicate a high level of development. Conversely, a low level of energy consumption tends to indicate that a nation has a low level of industrial activity. Most of the people work with simple tools rather than machines. Workforce Another sign of low-level development is that a large share of the population works in agriculture. Why is that the case? If most people are raising food just for themselves, few are available to work in industry. As a result, there is little opportunity for workers to specialize. As you read earlier, specialization makes an economy more efficient and productive. It also allows workers to focus on particular jobs, which enables them to earn cash income. Social Indicators Three social indicators also measure a nation&apos;s level of development. The first is literacy rate, the proportion of the population over age 15 who can read and write. In general, a high percentage of people attending school suggests a high level of development. An educated population has the potential to be more productive and to use or produce advanced technology. Another indicator is life expectancy, the average expected life span of an individual. It indicates how well an economic system supports life. People who are well nourished and housed and have access to medical care live longer. A population that lacks food and adequate housing and is exposed to poor sanitation and disease will have a shorter life expectancy. A country&apos;s infant mortality rate indicates the number of deaths that occur in the first year of life per 1,000 live births. For example, in the United States, out of every 1,000 infants born alive in a given year, 5.9 of them die before they reach their first birthdays. This means that the United States has an infant mortality rate of 5.9. Generally speaking, the lower a nation&apos;s infant mortality rate, the higher its level of development.

Burning rainforests to create palm plantations in Indonesia has increased GDP but spread pollution internationally across Southeast Asia. Industrialization boosts development, but by increasing energy consumption, it has the negative externality of increasing air pollution. On the other hand, as economies grow more developed, they can afford energy-saving technologies that create positive externalities for the environment by reducing pollution. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS How is energy use related to development? Indicators of Developed Nations Developed nations have high per capita GDPs, and the majority of the population is neither very rich nor very poor. In general, people in these nations enjoy a greater degree of economic and political freedom than do those in less developed countries. Quality of Life Levels of consumer spending are high in developed nations. For example, in the United States, almost 75 percent of households have computers. The populations of developed nations are generally healthy, with low infant mortality rates and high life expectancy. Literacy rates are high as well. People tend to receive schooling well into their teens, and many go on to college. High Productivity In most developed nations, agricultural output is high, but relatively few people work on farms. For example, with the equipment available today, a single farmer in the United States can feed 155 people. Agriculture has largely become a high-tech big business: New technologies are making the profession of farming more efficient, less risky, and less labor-intensive. . . . [Big farmers] are automating the entire farming process using GPS technology, genetically modified PRIMITIVE EQUILIBRIUM TRANSITION Society has a traditional economy, with no formal economic organization or monetary system. The economy, focused on consumer goods and public services, easily meets basic human needs.

Widespread use of technology increases the productivity of this workforce, too. Urbanization and Infrastructure Developed nations tend to be urban rather than rural. Most of their populations live in cities and towns and have done so for many years. Major cities such as New York, London, and Tokyo are centers of finance and trade. Hand-in-hand with urbanization goes a solid infrastructure. Power plants enhance a nation&apos;s capacity to produce goods. Transportation and communication systems allow easier transfer of products, services, people, and ideas. Schools increase a nation&apos;s literacy rate and productive capacity. Banks allow for secure transfer of financial assets. SUPPORT IdEAS WITh ExAMPLES What forms of infrastructure support urbanization? Indicators of Less Developed Nations Less developed countries generally have low per capita GDPs. Their per capita energy consumption is also low, which is an indicator of their limited level of industrialization. These characteristics affect LDCs&apos; ability to produce goods efficiently and to provide their citizens with a satisfactory standard of living. Low Productivity Many people in LDCs engage in subsistence agriculture, raising only enough food to feed themselves and their families. Subsistence agriculture requires heavy labor, leaving fewer workers available for industry or services. Unemployment rates are high in less developed countries, often around 20 percent. In addition, much of the labor force in these nations is underemployed. Often people who are underemployed have work, but not enough to support themselves or their families because they work less than full time. Quality of Life Even if an LDC could produce a large quantity of consumer goods&ndash;which they generally do not&ndash;most of the population would be unable to buy them. Subsistence-level agriculture and underemployment do not provide families with enough income to buy these goods. Consumer goods that are produced are often shipped out of the country and sold in more developed nations. A less developed country has trouble educating its populace. Resources for schools are limited. In addition, children are often needed to work on the family farm, limiting the amount of time they can spend in school. As a result, literacy rates in LDCs are very low. In Afghanistan, for example, only about 28 percent of the people over 15 years old can read and write. Compare this figure with the United States, where the literacy rate is nearly 100 percent. In the world&apos;s poorest countries, housing and diet are of poor quality. Along with limited access to healthcare, these factors lead to high infant mortality rates and short life expectancy. There are additional characteristics common to most LDCs. In the next Lesson, you will read about some of the difficult issues challenging less developed countries. INfER Why do most people in LDCs have few consumer goods? ASSESSMENT 1.

In this section, you will see what LDCs and the world community are doing to combat these conditions and encourage economic growth. As long ago as 1798, the English economist Thomas Malthus predicted that rapid population growth would become a serious problem: The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man . . . . The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions.

    <page pageNumber="527"> <text><![CDATA[ Thanks to modern technology, the earth now produces more food than Malthus could have imagined. Still, rapid population growth remains one of the most pressing issues facing many less developed countries. The already poor economies of many LDCs have trouble meeting the needs of their rapidly growing populations. Measuring Population Growth The population growth rate is a measure of how rapidly a country&apos;s population increases in a given year. It is expressed as a percentage of the population figure at the start of the year. The population growth rate takes into account the number of babies born, the number of people who died, and the number of people who migrated to or from a country. Compare the growth rates shown in Figure 10.9. Average population growth of less developed countries is estimated to be around 1.8 percent. This may sound low to you, but at this rate the population of LDCs will increase by nearly two thirds from 2007 to 2050. That is more than 20 times the population growth of developed nations during the same period. Causes of Rapid Population Growth Rapid population growth has several causes. Many LDCs are experiencing increased life expectancy. While people are living longer, birth rates in some LDCs have not decreased. When births far outpace deaths, the population grows. Age structure also contributes to rapid population growth. In many LDCs, a high proportion of the population is of childbearing age. As these younger adults have children, the population continues to grow. The question for the future is whether these families will choose to have as many children as their parents did. Birth rates have been declining in parts of the world, which may signal a new trend. In developed nations, a larger segment of the population is older, so population increases at a much slower rate. Population Growth Challenges As its population grows, a country must expand employment opportunities, healthcare, education, and infrastructure just to maintain its existing standard of living. To actually improve the lives of its people, a nation has to generate a higher per capita GDP. Economic output must grow faster than the population grows. In a less developed country with a high population growth rate, such accelerated economic Population Growth Rates of Selected Nations, 2012 –0.5 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Kuwait Chad Guatemala Afghanistan Venezuela Haiti Mexico Canada United States Sweden Austria Czech Republic Japan Population growth rate (percent) SOURCE: World Bank >> Figure 10.9 Analyze Graphs Which of the selected countries have a population growth rate higher than the average 1.8 percent for less developed countries? 10.5 Growth, Resources, and Development 461 ]]></text>

A primary reason is that these LDCs lack various factors of production. dETERMINE POINT Of VIEW What did English economist Thomas Malthus predict in 1798, and what influenced his prediction? Obstacles to Development In parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, physical geography is a serious obstacle to development. Natural resources are not evenly distributed throughout the world. Some nations lack mineral resources or fertile farmland. Harsh temperatures, uncertain rainfall, and vulnerability to natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes also contribute to the economic problems of some LDCs. The problem is not always lack of resources. Rather, less developed countries often lack the means to use their resources efficiently. Technology can help LDCs develop the resources they do have. Technology, however, is costly and requires much capital. The formation of capital is another important obstacle to development. Physical Capital The low productivity typical of LDCs is due in part to lack of physical capital. Without capital, industry cannot grow, and farm output remains low. Also, subsistence agriculture does not give farmers the opportunity to save. As a result, they do not have the cash to purchase capital Education and Literacy that would make their farm work more productive or to pay for goods and services that would improve their lives. Educating and Training Growing Populations Lack of human capital also hinders development. To be able to move beyond mere subsistence, a nation needs an educated workforce. Education and training allow people to develop new skills and adapt to new technologies and processes. As you have read, however, many less developed countries have low literacy rates. Figure 10.10 compares figures for education and literacy in the United States and several other countries. Two factors combine to lower literacy rates in these countries. First, only three out of four children in LDCs who begin primary school are still in school four years later. Many children are forced to leave school because they are needed at home to work on family farms. Second, in many LDCs, the literacy rate for women lags far behind that for men. Many women in these countries begin raising children at an early age. Those who do work have limited job opportunities and earn low wages. In addition, some cultures devalue women. Due to all these factors, a large part of a country&apos;s population lacks the training needed to be highly productive. Nutrition and Health Poor nutrition and health also impede the development of human capital.

How many years was that, and what effect would the steep increase have had on people in LDCs? malnutrition, or consistently inadequate nutrition. (A worldwide increase in food prices in 2008 through 2011 aggravated the situation.) Malnutrition lowers the energy of adults and makes them more vulnerable to disease. Both results can reduce worker productivity. Malnutrition also slows the physical and mental development of children, hurting their chances of being productive workers once they become adults. In many LDCs, poor sanitation leads to the spread of disease. In addition, many poorer countries have high rates of infection by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. This epidemic removes large numbers of workers from the workforces of these countries. In addition, caring for these people and their families puts a strain on the resources of many LDCs. Money that could be spent on schools or infrastructure has to be devoted to healthcare or providing for orphaned children. dRAW CONCLUSIONS Why is lack of physical capital, such as farm machinery, an obstacle to development? Political Barriers to Growth Political factors may also limit or even reverse a nation&apos;s development. Many LDCs are former colonies of European powers. Colonies had to supply the ruling powers with resources and rely on them for manufactured goods. This dependency prevented the development of industry. In the decades after World War II, these colonies won independence. Many then turned to central planning, rather than free enterprise, as the way to modernize their economies quickly. These nations made some gains at first, but in the long run, central planning hindered their economic growth. Many are now making the transition to free enterprise systems. Government corruption has also held back development in many LDCs. Some leaders have funneled huge sums of money into private accounts, allowing them to live luxurious lives while large numbers of their people remain poor. Civil war and social unrest have plagued many countries, including El Salvador and, more recently, the Central African Republic, Syria, and Nigeria. Years of fighting may leave millions dead and millions more as refugees. Loss of workers, as well as damage to resources and infrastructure, can throw a nation&apos;s economy into chaos. 10.5 Growth, Resources, and Development 463 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="530"> <text><![CDATA[ Finally, economic policies in many LDCs have favored small minorities. In some countries, policies benefit city dwellers and not the rural majority. In some, leaders favor only one ethnic group&ndash;typically their own. In extreme cases, governments practice policies of genocide&ndash;the attempted extermination of an entire ethnic or religious group. International organizations like the World Bank work with developing countries to help them fight corruption and develop into free enterprise systems. In Burundi, for example, the organization is helping the government protect and consolidate the country&apos;s transition from an economy torn by conflict to a more stable economy. The Bank is working with Burundi to strengthen public finance management, promote private-sector development and economic diversification, and improve protection of vulnerable groups. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT How did colonialism adversely affect economic development in the colonized countries? Finance and Development Building an infrastructure, providing services, and creating technology and industry all require large sums of money. A developing country can acquire these funds through a variety of means. These include internal financing, foreign investment, borrowing, and foreign aid. However, many of these solutions&ndash;especially borrowing&ndash;create problems of their own. Internal Financing In many ways, the most favorable source of development funds is internal financing. Internal financing is capital derived from the savings of a country&apos;s own citizens. As you read earlier, when savers deposit money in banks or other financial institutions, some of the money is used to make loans to firms. Firms invest in physical and human capital so they can expand, creating new jobs. Job growth enables workers to improve their standard of living. They buy more goods and services, which encourages businesses to expand further. As a result, the entire economy grows. In most LDCs, though, large segments of the population do not have enough money to save. The wealthy few often keep their money in foreign banks or invest in foreign firms because these investments are safer.

What are the two largest categories of spending? Bounce to Activate Chart capital available from internal financing. In order to fund development, they must turn to foreign sources. Foreign Investment Capital that originates in other countries is called foreign investment. There are two types of foreign investment: direct investment and portfolio investment. Foreign direct investment occurs when investors establish a business in another country. For example, multinational corporations often build factories or other facilities in an LDC. Multinationals make this investment to take advantage of natural resources available in the less developed country or to tap into the large and cheap labor force. As you have seen, multinationals are controversial. Some economists say that the people of the LDC who work for the foreign corporation are better off than they would be doing other work. Their wages give them cash they can use to buy goods, which can help stimulate their country&apos;s economy. Critics say that multinationals exploit workers by paying them less than they would pay workers in developed nations. Critics also charge that multinationals can hurt a nation&apos;s economic growth by taking profits out of the country. Instead of building businesses, foreign investors can make purchases in another country&apos;s financial markets. This is known as foreign portfolio investment. For example, an American investor might buy shares in a mutual fund. The mutual fund then buys stock in a foreign company. That company can use the funds to build another plant or to pay for research and development. Still, portfolio investment does present some problems. Since the investors live in another country, some or all of the company&apos;s profits may be drained away from the LDC. Borrowing and Debt In the 1970s and 1980s, many less developed countries acquired loans from foreign governments and private banks to finance development. Some of that money was misspent because of inexperience or political corruption. Changes in the world economy also caused problems for the LDCs. As oil prices rose, they borrowed more money to buy needed fuel. Also, many of the loans were issued in&ndash;and had to be repaid in&ndash;U.S. dollars. When the value of the dollar increased in the 1980s, many LDCs found it impossible to repay their loans. Once again, many were forced to borrow even more funds. As a result, the foreign debt in some countries grew to be greater than their annual GDP. As you will see, the world financial community has sought ways to relieve this severe debt crunch. Foreign Aid Sometimes, rather than making loans to developing nations, foreign governments give money and other forms of aid. For instance, 10.5 Growth, Resources, and Development 465 ]]></text>

These foreign aid grants do not need to be repaid. Foreign aid can be motivated by humanitarian concerns. At the same time, developed nations have military, political, economic, and cultural reasons to extend aid to LDCs. In the years following World War II, for instance, American officials gave aid to countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to try to block the influence of the Soviet Union in those areas. In the early 2000s, the United States provided money to Iraq and Afghanistan. American leaders hoped to fight international terrorism by building stable democracies in those countries. CATEgORIzE How is a foreign aid grant different from making a loan to a developing nation? Promoting Development Several international economic organizations promote development. The most prominent institutions are the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the International Monetary Fund. In addition, privately run aid groups give economic help and advice in some less developed countries. World Bank The largest provider of development assistance is the World Bank, founded in 1944. As discussed earlier, the World Bank raises money on world financial markets and also accepts contributions from the wealthier member nations. The World Bank uses these funds to offer loans and other resources to more than 100 less developed countries. The World Bank also coordinates with other organizations to promote development throughout the world and provides advice to LDCs on how to build their economies. United Nations Development Programme The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is dedicated to the elimination of poverty. The UNDP is one of the world&apos;s largest sources of grant funding for economic and social development. It assists over 177 countries and territories, in which the majority of the world&apos;s poorest people live. The UNDP is funded by voluntary contributions made by United Nations member states and agencies. International Monetary Fund As you already learned, the International Monetary Fund was founded in 1946 to stabilize international exchange The World Bank, UN Development Program, and IMF WORLD BANK UNDP IMF 194419651944Founding Purpose Recent Programs The World Bank gives financial and technical assistance to developing countries.

It also intervenes when LDCs need help in financing their international transactions. If a country has trouble repaying a debt, the IMF may arrange a rescheduling plan. Debt rescheduling is an agreement between a lending nation and a debtor nation.The lending nation lengthens the time of debt repayment and forgives, or dismisses, part of the loan. In return, the LDC agrees to accept a stabilization program, changing its economic policies to meet IMF goals. A typical stabilization program involves providing incentives that will lead to higher export earnings and to fewer imports. By increasing exports, the LDC earns more foreign money to pay off its debt. Stabilization programs are controversial because they can have a negative impact on the poor in the short term. They often require the LDC to lift wage and price controls. As wages drop and prices rise, the poor suffer. Stabilization may also force a government to cut spending on health, food, and education. Negative experiences in East Asia and Argentina have led some critics to question whether IMF policies are the most effective way to repair a troubled economy. Nongovernmental Organizations Some private aid groups also work to help LDCs build their economies. Nongovernmental organizations(NGOs) are independent groups that raise money to fund aid and development programs. Examples include the Red Cross, CARE, and the World Wildlife Fund. Some NGOs focus on providing food or medical help when natural disasters or wars cause problems. For instance, Oxfam International provides food to poor countries when they face extreme needs. Others try to promote development. For example, Heifer International gives animals to families in less developed countries. Families use these animals to produce and sell products such as wool, milk, or honey. In 1976, Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh founded the Grameen Bank. Since then, the bank has extended its operations to nearly every continent. The bank makes small loans&ndash;often, as little as a few dollars&ndash;to poor people.

Identify the economic challenges faced by developing nations in Africa and Latin America. >> Key Terms privatization special economic zones Changing Economies Moving Toward a Market Economy The same is true of nations. Economic change&ndash;even change for the better&ndash;always brings new challenges. Today, many countries are undergoing economic transition. Some are enjoying rapid growth, while others are changing their entire economic systems. In this Lesson, you will look at the changing economies of Russia, China, India, and the countries of Africa and Latin America. For many nations, economic transition has meant moving from central planning to a market-based economy. In a command economy, the government owns and controls the factors of production. By contrast, in a market-based economy, the factors of production are owned and controlled by individuals. One of the first steps, then, in moving to a market economy is to sell or transfer government-owned businesses to individuals. This process is called privatization. Privatizing Business A government can privatize businesses in several ways. It could simply sell the business to one owner.

A third option is to give every citizen a voucher that can be used to purchase shares in whatever businesses they wish, once those businesses are privatized. Privatization can be a painful process. Only profitable enterprises will survive in a free market. No one will want to buy unprofitable ones, so many people will lose their jobs. Other job opportunities will eventually appear as the economy grows. However, the initial transition can be difficult for workers accustomed to jobs guaranteed by the government. Another concern is corruption. Government leaders might make it easier for their own friends and associates to gain control of businesses. The result is an unfair distribution of ownership. Protecting Property Rights Moving to a market economy also requires changes in the legal system. Centrally planned economies have no need to protect private property rights. A free market economy, however, cannot function without such protections. As a result, the government must create new laws that ensure a person&apos;s right to own and transfer property. Such a basic overhaul of the legal system takes time. Work Ethic and Attitudes In a planned economy, workers grow used to security. Many have guaranteed jobs in which their only concern is to meet government quotas. In the free market, such guarantees do not exist. Incentives, not quotas, motivate people&apos;s labor. As a result, workers in a transitioning economy need to learn a new work ethic. Not surprisingly, people accustomed to central planning often worry about how change will affect them. They might resist the shift to the free market out of fear and uncertainty. APPLy CONCEPTS Why does moving to a market economy require changes in the legal system? Changes in Russia Russia has faced all of the challenges described above. It was once part of the Soviet Union, the world&apos;s most powerful communist nation. But in 1991, Soviet communism&ndash;and the Soviet Union itself&ndash; collapsed. Russia and the other former Soviet republics began the difficult transition toward a free market economy. The End of Soviet Communism Under communism, government planners directed the Soviet economy. The nation became an industrial METHODEXAMPLEUSE VOUCHERS SELL SHARES TO INVESTORS SELL BUSINESSES TO INDIVIDUALS Poland privatized retail shops and small industrial businesses in the early 1990s. The assets of the businesses were typically paid for with periodic payments. While not a command economy, the United Kingdom had state-owned businesses. It sold shares of many of these in the 1980s, tripling the number of individual investors in the U.K. In 1991, citizens in Czechoslovakia purchased privatization vouchers that were used to bid for shares in as much as 80% of the state enterprises.

The Soviet Union was enormous and rich in many resources, but in the long run, its economy was unable to use those resources to provide for its people. Citizens faced frequent shortages of consumer goods, and the goods they did get were often of poor quality. In the late 1980s, a new Soviet leader named Mikhail Gorbachev began a series of dramatic political and economic changes to revive the country&apos;s stagnant economy. Gorbachev did not want to overturn the communist economic and political system. Rather, he hoped to incorporate the use of markets and incentives into the existing structure of communism. The transition to free market economics created problems, however. Economic reform produced some initial hardships. People lost secure government jobs, benefits, and pensions. Many people, especially the elderly, were hurt financially. Some Russians did begin to make the new system work for them, starting their own businesses and prospering. Still, unrest grew. At the same time, some officials and army officers feared that the central government was becoming weak. In 1991, they tried to restore old-style communism. The attempt backfired. One by one, the 15 Soviet republics declared their independence. The largest of the new nations was the Russian Republic. Russian Oil Production, 2002–2011 A Hard Transition Russia&apos;s new president, Boris Yeltsin, promised rapid progress toward a market economy. Despite some improvements, hardships continued. When Yeltsin lifted price controls in 1992, prices skyrocketed. People on fixed incomes, such as retirees living on government pensions, could not afford to buy basics like food and clothing. In the new Russia, wealth tended to become concentrated in cities such as Moscow. The uneven distribution of income led many to call for additional change. It also led to extensive corruption and widespread organized crime. Billions of dollars in financial aid flooded into the country from the World Bank, the IMF, and independent investors. However, due to mismanagement and corruption, these funds were not used efficiently. By 1998, the Russian economy was in a shambles. Debt was high, investor confidence was low, and the nation was in the midst of an economic crisis. Russia in the 21st Century Tight controls from the central government, combined with rising prices for Russian oil, allowed Russian leaders to stem the crisis and repay foreign debt. According to the World Bank, Russia had the world&apos;s sixth-largest GDP in 2012, due to its oil- and export-driven economy. Economic growth has fed growing consumer demand.

SUPPORT IdEAS WITh ExAMPLES Name one economic problem Russia faced before the transition to a free market economy and one problem after the transition. Growth in Asia Through Trade Asia, the world&apos;s largest continent, is home to more than 4 billion people&ndash;over 60 percent of the world&apos;s total population. These people provide a huge workforce and a huge market for goods and services. In recent decades, Asia has become one of the most dynamic players in the global economy. Nations such as Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan have incomes comparable to highly developed nations in the rest of the world. China is a major exporter of goods and a key trading partner of the United States. India, too, has experienced rapid economic growth. How did these two nations, once among the world&apos;s poorest, advance so far, so rapidly? China In 1949, after a long civil war, communists led by Mao Zedong took power in China. They quickly put in place communist policies, giving the government ownership of all land, resources, and enterprises. Government planners made all key decisions about the economy. After Mao died in 1976, Deng Xiaoping became China&apos;s new leader. Deng soon began using the tools of the free market to increase productivity. He gave farmers and factory managers more freedom to make decisions about what to produce and how much to charge for it. He also rewarded farmers, managers, and workers who increased output. With such incentives, production increased. Deng also set up four free market centers along China&apos;s east coast. Foreign businesses could operate, and local governments were allowed to offer tax incentives to foreign investors in these special 10.6 Changing Economies 471 ]]></text>

This approach proved so successful that China now has hundreds of these zones. Deng&apos;s successors have continued his policies. The economic changes, especially increased trade, have led to huge economic growth. Where the country once lagged far behind most nations of Europe and North America, China in 2013 had the world&apos;s second most productive economy, after the United States. In 2009, China became the world&apos;s largest exporter of goods. Since 2011, consumer spending by Chinese citizens has been a bigger driver of growth than investment. Chinese cities are now full of people who enjoy access to a wide variety of consumer goods. Still, development has brought its share of problems. Rapid urban growth has led to increases in crime and pollution. The poor complain that the government is abandoning its promise to provide jobs and healthcare for all the nation&apos;s people. In addition, growth has not reached all parts of the country. The government has announced that it is >> Rapid industrialization without government regulation has caused damage to the environment in China. Heavy pollution is an ongoing problem, and it is common for people to wear face masks outside, as these Beijing pedestrians are doing. planning to focus less on trade in the coming years and more on economic reform and education. Finally, economic development has not meant political liberty. Chinese citizens still do not enjoy many political rights. The government tightly controls the press and stifles dissent. India India is the world&apos;s second most populous nation, after China. A former British colony, India struggled economically after winning independence. In the 1990s, though, India&apos;s government began to invite foreign investment and promote other free market practices. New policies encouraged Indian companies to expand. One area of significant growth was in high- technology industries. Many software companies opened new facilities in India, where educated workers could offer technical support to computer users around the world. Manufacturing grew as well. Economic growth helped promote the emergence of a much larger middle class. One business executive noted the significance of this development: When half the population in a society is middle class, its politics will change . . . its poor will be fewer&ndash;and society will have greater means to look after them. &ndash;Gurcharan Das, “India&apos;s Growing Middle Class” India&apos;s middle class provides a growing market for consumer goods. As the middle class seeks more (and more expensive) goods, local and foreign producers compete to meet that demand. Still, as with China, India&apos;s development is not complete. Over half of the labor force farms, and only 19 percent is employed in industry. The result is a growing gap between the richest and poorest citizens. In fact, this is true of virtually all nations with developing economies. Urban dwellers with education and skills benefit the most from growth. Uneducated people in poor rural areas struggle with poverty and continue to rely on subsistence farming.

Some nations in these two regions have seen great economic growth in recent years. Others continue to struggle. Continuing Poverty in Africa Some North African nations have built productive economies. This success is mainly due to large reserves of oil. South of the Sahara, however, most nations face the obstacles common to all less developed countries. Economies are largely based on subsistence farming. Low literacy rates, inadequate healthcare and nutrition, high rates of HIV infection, and mounting debt hinder development efforts. Some nations are also plagued by years of civil war or ethnic conflict. Only two African nations south of the Sahara have sizable economies&ndash;South Africa and Nigeria. Nigeria benefits from large reserves of oil. Yet over-dependence on oil has slowed growth in other areas. Nigeria also suffers from widespread political corruption and ethnic conflict. However, President Goodluck Jonathan, who became president in 2010, promised to reform the country&apos;s electoral process, tackle corruption, and resolve Nigeria&apos;s energy problems. In the 1990s, South Africa shifted from longtime rule by its white minority to black majority rule. Problems in this political transition, along with high rates of HIV infection, slowed economic growth. Unemployment remains high, and poverty remains a problem. Still, South Africa has one of the 25 highest GDPs in the world. It benefits from a rich array of natural resources and a strong manufacturing base. Different Paths in Latin America In Latin America, the two biggest success stories are Brazil and Mexico. Both countries have abundant resources. Both have also taken steps to make their economies more diverse. Brazil exports iron ore and timber, and its land and climate are highly suitable for growing coffee and soybeans. The discovery of large offshore oil reserves in late 2007 promises to turn Brazil into a major oil-exporting power. Oil production grew from around 2,300 barrels a day in 2007 to 2,600 barrels a day in 2012. Brazil has become a strong manufacturing power, producing everything from vehicles to shoes. It has also adapted its sugar industry to produce ethanol. Brazil builds cars that can run on either gasoline or ethanol. More than 40 percent of the fuel that powers Brazilian cars comes from ethanol derived from sugar cane. Mexico has reserves of oil and silver and produces rich crops of cotton and coffee.

By diversifying their economies, Mexico and Brazil have freed 80 percent or more of their labor forces from farm work. Employment in manufacturing and service industries has helped these two economies grow. Venezuela also has large reserves of oil. Its leadership turned in a different direction, though. President Hugo Chávez shifted the economy away from the market system to socialism. In addition to the oil industry, Chávez nationalized agricultural, financial, telecommunications, construction, and steel companies. He promised to use money derived from the sale of oil and gas to eliminate poverty and improve health and education. These advances have yet to be seen, however. The successor to Chávez, President Nicolás Maduro, is expected to continue along the same political path.

The economies of the world&apos;s nations are interconnected in deep and complex ways&ndash;and they will remain interconnected. The global economy creates new issues that business managers, workers, and government leaders must take into account. In this lesson, you will look at many of these issues, from impact on the environment to increased competition for American businesses. The increasingly tight interconnection of producers, consumers, and financial systems around the world is known as globalization. Such connections are not a new phenomenon. In the Middle Ages, the Asian spice trade connected Europe, Asia, and Africa. The voyages of Columbus led to the colonization of the Americas by European sea powers and to the development of the African slave trade. The Age of Imperialism that began in the late 1800s forged even closer links between the economies of Europe and the United States and those of Africa and Asia. Still, globalization today is taking place at a much faster pace than in the past. Several factors contribute to the ever- tightening links between economies around the world. They include the development of faster methods of communication and transportation, the widespread adoption of elements of the free enterprise system, and the growth of international trade agreements.

All these innovations allowed greater movement of products, people, and ideas. Today, as in the past, globalization depends on breaking through barriers of time and space. In the past, camels and ships made it possible to trade across vast deserts and oceans. Today, jet airplanes allow producers to sell goods in distant markets that would have been impossible to reach quickly in the past. For example, flower growers in the Netherlands or Colombia can send fresh flowers for sale in the United States. Today&apos;s communications revolution has also sped up the pace of globalization. Thanks to satellite communications, customers and suppliers on opposite sides of the world can talk quickly and clearly. Computers give people greater access to information about the availability and prices of products in distant countries. Investors in one country can get up-to-date information and use it to buy stocks on financial markets anywhere. Expansion of the Free Market As you read earlier, many nations have moved away from central planning. Even some communist governments have chosen to pursue free market policies. As a result, the proportion of the world that practices free market economics has more than tripled. At the same time, the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has allowed nations that had once been locked out of world trade to enter the global marketplace. The new free market economies are more open to foreign investment. In 1975, the value of foreign direct investment worldwide totaled only about $23 billion. By 2012, the total had grown to $1.4 trillion. The opening of new markets has created new investment opportunities as countries across the globe learn the benefits of a free enterprise system. It has also created new global economic ties. Trade Agreements Earlier, you read that many nations have signed regional trade agreements. This is another example of the role of government in economic systems. Some trade agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership under consideration in 2014, must pass both houses of Congress to become law. The United States is the world&apos;s most productive single economy, with output far exceeding that Foreign Direct Investment in Latvia 10 6 8 4 2 0 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 SOURCE: Bank of Latvia, 2012 Euros (in billions) >> Latvia, once part of the Soviet Union, now practices free market economics.

However, the combinedoutput of the 28 nations that make up the European Union (EU) is competitive with that of the United States. The democratically elected governments of the EU recognize the benefits of free enterprise and of trading blocs. People, goods, and services can flow freely among members of the EU, making it almost like a single economy. Concern about competition from the EU was one of the factors that spurred the United States, Canada, and Mexico to sign the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). With the passage of NAFTA and the lowering of trade barriers, businesses had increased incentives to take part in regional trade. Trading blocs do not remain fixed. The EU has repeatedly expanded to include more nations. It is also working to forge trade ties with other regions. All of this activity has added to the tighter globalization of the world economy. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS How have modern communications contributed to globalization? Challenges of Globalization “Arguing against globalization,” said former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, “is like arguing against the laws of gravity.” While globalization is a fact of modern economic life, it has also created challenges. Closely Linked Financial Markets In 2007 and 2008, many American financial firms lost money&ndash; or went out of business&ndash;as a result of making too many risky home mortgage loans. Worried that the crisis would cause a downturn in the economy, investors sold stocks. Heavy losses on the New York Stock Exchange raised concerns among investors elsewhere in the world. They, in turn, sold stocks on European and Asian exchanges. The ripple effect caused by this American financial crisis is not unique. In recent decades, economic problems in Mexico, Japan, Russia, and Argentina had a similar impact on world financial markets. Why do financial problems in one country affect people in another? The reason is that world financial markets are closely connected. Computerization has allowed investors around the world to watch >> South Korean shoppers line up to buy beef imported from the United States.

They move quickly to buy the stock of promising companies in whatever country they find them&ndash;and sell just as quickly at any sign of trouble. Another reason for the widespread impact of these financial crises is the booming trade in currencies on foreign exchange markets. As you read earlier, most of the world now follows a flexible exchange-rate system. The values of various national currencies go up or down every day. Investors holding money in a particular currency sell it off if the value of that currency declines. As sales of a country&apos;s currency mount, its economy will suffer. These effects do not just hurt investors who risk their money in the hope of making profits. They have an impact on ordinary people as well. Banks buy assets in other countries. If the value of those assets falls, the banks have less capital available to make loans to people in their own countries. Multinational Corporations As you read in an earlier Lesson, the expansion of multinational corporations has sparked controversy. Some economists argue that these companies have a beneficial impact on the countries in which they set up operations. For example, multinationals have been >> Hyundai Motor Company is a Korean multinational with automobile factories and showrooms in the United States and other nations around the world, including the Czech Republic and Russia. credited with much of the development of Eastern Europe after the fall of communism: [Multinationals] brought countless benefits. These include . . . improving the environment; rescuing collapsing factories and rotting company towns; establishing new industries; laying new telecommunications networks; stabilizing banking systems . . . and facing down corrupt vested interests in governments that in too many cases had plundered their own countries. &ndash;Paul Lewis, “Harnessing the Power of the Multinationals” Multinationals have the capital to introduce technology to developing countries, offer jobs, train the labor force, and provide the opportunity for related services and industries to develop. Critics, however, claim that multinationals do little to aid less developed countries. Some point out that most of the profits go not to the host LDC, but to the foreign owners of the corporation. Others say that multinationals create far fewer job opportunities than they claim. Many of the industries are highly mechanized, allowing high productivity with little labor. Thus, they provide few jobs relative to the massive size of the labor pool and may even drive traditional craftworkers out of business. Another area of controversy is wages. Generally, wages in less developed countries are very low compared with wages in industrialized nations. Supporters argue that the lower wages are justified since the cost of living in LDCs is also relatively low. In addition, many of the people employed by multinationals might not have jobs otherwise. Critics argue that multinationals benefit unfairly from the low wages. Also, many LDCs do not require companies to provide the same high standard of working conditions that industrialized countries require. Loss of Jobs Much of the debate over multinationals and globalization focuses on the impact on less developed countries. However, people in developed nations are equally concerned about a related issue&ndash;the loss of jobs. 478 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="545"> <text><![CDATA[ In the global economy, companies may move parts of their operations to other countries. This practice is known as offshoring. Offshoring may involve a single process, as when an American bank hires a call center in India or Kenya to handle its telemarketing. Or it can be total, as when a multinational manufacturer closes a plant in the United States to build one in another country, where labor is cheaper. In either case, the result is job loss. As you learned earlier, movement of jobs overseas is one of the key causes of structural unemployment. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT What problems can result when financial markets are interconnected? Migration People have always moved from place to place in hopes of building a better life. Globalization and development have accelerated these population shifts. Domestic Migration Much of this migration takes place domestically, within a nation&apos;s borders. In many less developed countries, cities offer more job opportunities than rural areas. As a result, large numbers of people in villages are streaming into cities. By 2012, more than 40 percent of the people in Africa and Asia lived in cities. Today, 22 of the world&apos;s 30 largest cities are located in less developed countries. Each of them has more than 10 million people. Rapid urbanization has caused several problems. Cities have grown so fast that they cannot provide enough housing, schools, or sanitation for all of their inhabitants. Poverty, crime, and disease are widespread. International Migration Each year, millions of workers leave less developed countries in the hopes of finding jobs in developed nations. This international migration has an economic impact on both the source country and the destination country. Most immigrants come legally, with proper visas and proof that they have jobs waiting for them. Although their labor contributes to a country&apos;s GDP, they may face resentment from native-born workers who view the newcomers as competition for jobs. Other people come without legal authorization. Illegal immigration raises security concerns and puts a strain on public resources. >> Rapid urbanization has led to the development of densely populated slums in some cities, including São Paulo, Brazil&apos;s largest city. >> When scientists or other professionals emigrate, their home country is hurt in two ways.

Once they find work, many immigrants send regular cash payments to their families back home. These remittances provide an important source of income. The World Bank estimated that, in 2013 alone, the value of remittances to LDCs totaled $410 billion. At the same time, many well-trained and educated people also leave LDCs for well-paying jobs in developed nations. This “brain drain” may hurt development by siphoning off vital human capital. Identi fy Cause an d Effect How does migration affect less developed countries? Ongoing Issues Globalization has created new opportunities but also new challenges for the world&apos;s economies. Some of these challenges have become sources of tension between the developed world and the developing world. Issues related to equal treatment and the environment are key causes of conflict, as is competition for scarce resources. A Greater Voice for the Developing World Leaders in less developed countries argue that international trade and financial policies favor the wealthier nations. In an effort to give emerging economies a greater voice, 19 countries plus the European Union have formed an organization called the Group of 20, or G20. The G20 includes officials from growing nations such as China, South Korea, Russia, India, South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as from the United States and Europe. The G20 has discussed such issues as promoting growth and combating the financing of terrorist operations. Environment Versus Development The environment can be another source of tension. Environmental scientists&ndash;mostly based in developed nations&ndash;worry that rapid development can cause environmental damage. They seek to promote sustainable development, that is, the goal of meeting current development needs without using up the resources needed by future generations. On the other hand, government leaders in many less developed nations see an urgent need to exploit their resources now. They view combating poverty and creating modern economies as a higher priority than protecting the environment. Developed nations, they argue, were able to use resources such as oil without restriction. LDCs now seek the same opportunity. One major issue is deforestation, or largescale destruction of forests. Many developing nations are cutting down forests at a rapid rate.

Environmentalists warn that deforestation contributes to global warming and destroys rare animal and plant species. Competition for Resources A related challenge is competition for scarce resources. In some regions, it is increasingly difficult to find enough clean water to meet the needs of a growing population. In China, for example, rapid population growth and economic growth have led to serious contamination of an already uncertain water supply. Some experts warn that reserves of oil and gas are dwindling as well. They fear that unless new sources of these fuels&ndash;or different sources of energy&ndash;are found, the world&apos;s economies may grind to a halt. Case Study: The Atlantic Bluefin Tuna The Atlantic bluefin tuna is one of the world&apos;s most popular tunas. Although the Atlantic bluefin lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the main market for the bluefin is Japan, where it is often eaten as sushi. For many years, fishers from many countries caught Atlantic bluefins faster than they could reproduce. In 1969, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was formed to manage Atlantic tuna fisheries. However, for many years, ICCAT, under pressure from countries whose fishers depended on tuna, allowed tuna catches greater than the ability of tuna to reproduce. Environmentalists called the ICCAT “the International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna.” Finally, in 2009, as bluefin stocks fell to alarmingly low levels, and as more and more people realized that the bluefin could face extinction, the ICCAT issued much lower catch quotas. Still, fishers from some countries caught more bluefins than the quotas allowed. To try to enforce quotas, starting in 2011, member nations agreed to monitor catches by their fishers. By 2012, these new policies began to show some success. According to some measures, Atlantic bluefin stocks increased slightly for the first time since recordkeeping began. Different Perspectives on Resources There are two types of natural resources. Renewable resources are resources that replenish themselves naturally over the course of years or decades. Examples include timber from forests, sustainably harvested fish, and agricultural crops. Nonrenewable resources are resources that have a finite supply and that cannot be replaced or take millions of years to replace. Examples include coal, >> More than half of the world&apos;s rain forests, including huge areas of Brazil&apos;s Amazon, have been cut or burned to meet the demand for arable land and wood.

People in different parts of the United States and around the world have different perspectives on the use of these resources. For example, many people in developing nations rich in fossil fuels believe in extracting and selling those fuels to support their economies, while some people in developed nations believe that limits should be set on the use of those fuels to protect the climate. In the United States, people differ in their views on fossil fuel extraction, too. Some think that undersea oil deposits should be tapped off the coasts of Alaska, Florida, and other states along the Atlantic Coast. Others fear that tapping these oil fields could damage the environment and businesses such as tourism that rely on beautiful coastlines. Water is another resource on which perspectives can differ. For example, in Florida, fresh water from Lake Okeechobee has been diverted from the Everglades to support commercial agriculture. Some Floridians want to restore the flow of water to the Everglades to protect its ecosystem, while others think that supporting agriculture is more important. SUPPORT A POINT Of VIEW WITh EVIdENCE How might environmental protection conflict with economic development? The United States and the Global Economy Globalization poses challenges even for the world&apos;s most successful economy&ndash;our own. For the United States to compete in global markets, American workers must be ready to respond to changes in the workplace. And American companies must continue their long tradition of innovation. A Changing Workplace The workplace is not what it used to be. Manufacturing is still important, but information now drives the economy of the United States and the world. Workers need to gain the technical skills that are necessary to access, understand, and use all sorts of information. Education is more important than ever. The need for education does not end when people find jobs. Skilled workers must keep up-to-date with new technology so that they can remain productive in their current jobs. Others must learn completely new skills when they find that their existing jobs no longer pay a good wage&ndash;or when jobs are lost due to offshoring. Another feature of the changing American workplace is greater diversity.

The Pressure to Compete Globalization has made economic competition more intense. Consumers in developing nations are demanding a greater variety of products and services. More countries are competing to meet this growing demand. Competition affects business relationships as well. One firm might have a long relationship with a local supplier. Yet, if a different supplier can offer lower prices or better service, the firm will make a deal with that supplier&ndash;even when that supplier is located on the other side of the world. For all these reasons, American companies need to stay competitive. Business managers face constant pressure to cut costs and increase profits. They must ensure high productivity to avoid wasting money and work. They need to be constantly on the lookout for better ways to respond to customer needs. Only by staying competitive can American companies thrive. The Need to Innovate As in the past, growing competition spurs innovation. The companies that develop new products or processes can quickly gain a large share of the world market. For example, in 1996, two young American entrepreneurs began work on the Internet search engine company that became Google. Ten years later, the company had worldwide sales of $10.6 billion. By 2013, Google&apos;s sales had climbed to around $50 billion. Still, introducing an innovative product and enjoying its success is not the end of the story. Any new good or service can quickly be replaced by a newer one, developed by another entrepreneur hungry to succeed. Writer Thomas Friedman, who has studied globalization, says that the new economic world is like a sprint that competitors must run over and over again. Anyone who wins one race cannot guarantee winning a later one. The only solution is to go back to the starting line and&ndash;with fresh innovations to help&ndash;run as fast as possible, again and again.

In 2006, Janet Yellen delivered this speech on the impact of these links on U.S. monetary policy. At the time, Yellen was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of the member banks of the Federal Reserve System. In 2014, Yellen was named Chair of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve System, a position that puts her in charge of U.S. monetary policy. >> Janet Yellen was named Federal Reserve Chair in 2014, at a time of strong links between the U.S. and global economy. . . . Proponents of the view that globalization has affected U.S. inflation commonly claim that it has resulted in disinflationary pressures [pressures that lower inflation] over the last decade. For example, [former Federal Reserve Chairman] Alan Greenspan made precisely this argument in Congressional testimony last year, citing the massive new “army” of workers that has become available to engage in the world&apos;s markets&ndash;some 100 million plus from the former Soviet bloc, some 750 million from China, and the growing powerhouse of talent that India&apos;s workers represent. Beyond its direct impact on the level of U.S. inflation, proponents of this “new view” contend that globalization has altered the dynamics of inflation . . . In particular, their view is that globalization has weakened the traditional link between domestic resource utilization and inflation: With prices increasingly set in global markets, firms have less room to pass on higher costs . . . ; instead, they have to do what they can to control costs . . . As The Economist recently opined: “This makes a nonsense of traditional economic models of inflation, which virtually ignore globalization….” Some observers go even further, arguing that the slack [of unused labor or capital] that matters to inflation is not domestic slack but global slack. ExPLAIN AN ARgUMENT Consider the effect of supply and demand on price. Why would the addition of millions of new workers in Asia increase global slack and decrease inflation? . . . With respect to monetary policy, I find nothing either in theory or the existing empirical evidence to overturn the conclusion that a country like the United States, operating under a flexible exchange rate regime, can ultimately achieve the inflation target of its choice. . . . Linkages between globalization and inflation . . . The first channel is the most obvious one&ndash; the direct effect of the reductions in the prices of imported goods and services that may be caused by globalization, and which are included in the indices of consumer prices that central banks commonly target. . . . [I]t is also possible that globalization could reduce the sensitivity of domestic wages to changes in domestic labor market slack . . . Suppose, for example, that globalization has enhanced the opportunities for firms to substitute imports for domestic output. . . . Such substitution effectively increases the degree of competition between domestic and foreign workers. 484 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="551"> <text><![CDATA[ In the limit&ndash;when such substitution in effect creates a single global labor market&ndash;it could be that global, not domestic, labor market slack explains changes in U.S. wages and inflation. A distinct but related possibility is that globalization may be undermining the bargaining power of U.S. workers, making them more fearful of job loss, thus lowering wage demands and holding inflation down. . . . CITE EVIdENCE What evidence does Yellen present to support the argument that globalization might keep wages low in the United States? Evidence from import prices . . . The array of evidence . . . suggests that foreign factors have had some impact on U.S. prices&ndash;an impact that may be increasing&ndash;but overall it has been rather limited. Such findings should not come as a great surprise. Despite the growing trend toward integration, the U.S. is far&ndash;very far&ndash;from being fully integrated with the rest of the world&apos;s markets. As I just mentioned, imports still amount to a fairly small fraction of U.S. GDP. In addition, many U.S. goods are not traded, and despite stories about U.S. firms hiring programmers in Bangalore and typesetters in Beijing, they still have to “buy American” when it comes to a host of other services and trades, such as health care, entertainment, and construction. . . . CITE EVIdENCE What evidence does Yellen present to support the argument that globalization has a limited effect on U.S. inflation? Implications for monetary policy Let me now turn to the final portion of my remarks and attempt a response to the question: What implications does globalization have for the Fed&apos;s conduct of monetary policy? My main conclusion is that globalization has no impact on the Fed&apos;s ability to control inflation in the long run. . . However, globalization may have an effect on wage/price dynamics and, as such, may require that monetary policy be recalibrated to take these changes into account, much as was required in the latter half of the 1990s in response to the surge in productivity growth. From the perspective of monetary policy, globalization does matter. . . . Even so, globalization does nothing to imperil the Fed&apos;s ability to attain its inflation objectives. . . . . ASSESSMENT 1. Determine Central Ideas What is Yellen&apos;s main argument? 2. Identify Supporting Details What details does Yellen offer as evidence to support her main argument? 3. Assess an Argument Summarize Yellen&apos;s point of view on how the global economy affects U.S. monetary policy. What reasoning, evidence, word choices, and speaking techniques does she use?

Lesson 1: Why Nations Trade LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.2.12, SS.912.E.3.2 Nations have different natural resources and different specializations. Absolute advantage is the ability to produce more of a product with a given amount of resources. Comparative advantage is the ability to produce a product more efficiently than other products. Countries specialize in products for which they have comparative advantage. Specialization can lead to job gains in sectors with comparative advantage and job losses in other sectors. Lesson 2: Trade Barriers and Agreements SS.912.E.3.3 Trade barriers, such as tariffs or sanctions, can help domestic producers or safeguard national security, but they mean higher prices for consumers. NAFTA is a trade agreement&ndash;aiming to remove trade barriers and promote free trade&ndash;among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Through regional trade agreements and multinational corporations, economic links among nations have grown. Lesson 3: Exchange Rates and Trade LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.3.5 An exchange rate is the value of one currency in terms of another. When exchange rates change, they may boost imports or exports by making them cheaper. If a country imports more than it exports, as the United States does, it has a trade deficit. Countries with more exports than imports have trade surpluses. Lesson 4: Development SS.912.E.3.4, SS.912.E.3.5, SS.912.G.2.2 Development is a process of improving the well-being of a society. Economists use measures such as GDP to gauge development. Developed countries have higher productivity and quality of life than less developed countries. Lesson 5: Growth, Resources, and Development SS.912.G.2.2, SS.912.G.4.4 Rapid population growth, a lack of capital, limited education, poor health, war, political instability, and corruption are obstacles to development. Foreign investment and aid can promote development. International organizations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and nongovernmental organizations also promote development. Lesson 6: Changing Economies LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 Some less developed countries have boosted economic growth by shifting from centrally planned to market economies. This happened in Russia in the late 1900s and early 2000s. China and other Asian countries have also grown economically by promoting exports. Poor education, health issues, and unrest have entrenched poverty in much of Africa, while Latin American countries have seen economic growth. Lesson 7: Globalization LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.G.3.3, SS.912.G.4.4 Globalization is the increasing interconnection of producers, consumers, and financial systems worldwide. It has resulted from cheaper communications and the spread of free markets. Globalization may create dangerous links among financial markets and may cause jobs to move from high-wage to low-wage countries. It has highlighted a conflict between development and the environment. ]]></text>

Like earlier trade agreements, such as NAFTA, the TPP lowered trade barriers and provoked controversy. DOCUMENT A The Office of the United States Trade Representative provided this summary of the goals of TPP. [TPP] is a high-standard, ambitious, comprehensive, and balanced agreement that will promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections. We envision conclusion of this agreement, with its new and high standards for trade and investment in the Asia Pacific, as an important step toward our ultimate goal of open trade and regional integration across the region. &ndash;Website of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative DOCUMENT B During seven years of negotiations, the TPP sparked many protests, such as this one. DOCUMENT C Barack Obama, who was President when TPP was signed, explained why he supported it. We&apos;re not going to be able to isolate ourselves from world markets. We got to be in there and compete…. So the Trans-Pacific Partnership … reflects our values in ways that, frankly, some previous trade agreements did not. It&apos;s the highest-standard, most progressive trade deal in history. It&apos;s got strong, enforceable provisions for workers, preventing things like child labor. It&apos;s got strong, enforceable provisions on the environment. . . &ndash;President Barack Obama, remarks at Nike, May 8, 2015 DOCUMENT D Among the U.S. opponents of TPP was Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Let&apos;s be clear: the TPP is much more than a “free trade” agreement. It is part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system. &ndash;Senator Bernie Sanders, “The Trans-Pacific Trade (TPP) Agreement Must Be Defeated,” January 3, 2015 22. Documents A and C support the idea that TPP A. benefits American workers. B. is modeled after previous trade agreements. C. reverses the trend toward growing globalization. D. decreases trade barriers worldwide. 23. The point of view expressed in Document B most closely matches that in A. Document C. B. Document D. C. Documents A and D. D. Documents A and C. 24. Which claim in Document C is directly challenged in Document D? A. The United States cannot isolate itself from world markets. B. Some previous trade agreements did not reflect American values. C. TPP has enforceable provisions that benefit the environment. D. TPP will lead to further job loss through offshoring. 25. Writing Task Write a letter to your senator arguing for a specific decision regarding the TPP. Evaluate the credibility and accuracy of the sources presented here, noting discrepancies among them. Based on this information and what you have learned about trade agreements, suggest ways to solve any problems resulting from the decision you support. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="558"> <text><![CDATA[ United States Constitution United States Constitution The Preamble states the broad purposes the Constitution is intended to serve&ndash;to establish a government that provides for greater cooperation among the States, ensures justice and peace, provides for defense against foreign enemies, promotes the general well-being of the people, and secures liberty now and in the future. The phrase We the People emphasizes the twin concepts of popular sovereignty and of representative government. Legislative Department Section 1. Legislative power; Congress Congress, the nation&apos;s lawmaking body, is bicameral in form; that is, it is composed of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Framers of the Constitution purposely separated the lawmaking power from the power to enforce the laws (Article II, the Executive Branch) and the power to interpret them (Article III, the Judicial Branch). This system of separation of powers is supplemented by a system of checks and balances; that is, in several provisions the Constitution gives to each of the three branches various powers with which it may restrain the actions of the other two branches. Section 2. House of Representatives Clause 1. Election Electors means voters. Members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years. Each State must permit the same persons to vote for United States representatives as it permits to vote for the members of the larger house of its own legislature. The 17th Amendment (1913) extends this requirement to the qualification of voters for United States senators. Clause 2. Qualifications A member of the House of Representatives must be at least 25 years old, an American citizen for seven years, and a resident of the State he or she represents. In addition, political custom requires that a representative also reside in the district from which he or she is elected. Clause 3. Apportionment The number of representatives each State is entitled to is based on its population, which is counted every 10 years in the census. Congress reapportions the seats among the States after each census. In the Reapportionment Act of 1929, Congress fixed the permanent size of the House at 435 members with each State having at least one representative. Today there is one House seat for approximately every 700,000 persons in the population. The words “three-fifths of all other persons” referred to slaves and reflected the Three-Fifths Compromise reached by the Framers at Philadelphia in 1787; the phrase was made obsolete, was in effect repealed, by the 13th Amend ment in 1865. * The gray words indicate portions of the Constitution altered by subsequent amendments to the document. PREAMBLE We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. Article I. Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. Section 2. 1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. 2. No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty-five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. 3. Representatives and direct Taxes* shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and, until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three. Clause 4. Vacancies The executive authority refers to the governor of a State. If a member leaves office or dies before the expiration of his or her term, the governor is to call a special election to fill the vacancy. 4. When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies. 492 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="559"> <text><![CDATA[ 5. The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. Section 3. 1. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State chosen by the Legislature thereof for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote. 2. Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequences of the first Election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year; of the second Class, at the Expiration of the fourth Year; and of the third Class, at the Expiration of the sixth Year; so that one-third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies. 3. No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen. 4. The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided. 5. The Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States. 6. The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. 7. Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. Clause 5. Officers; impeachment The House elects a Speaker, customarily chosen from the majority party in the House. Impeachment means accusation. The House has the exclusive power to impeach, or accuse, civil officers; the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 6) has the exclusive power to try those impeached by the House. Section 3. Senate Clause 1. Composition, election, term Each State has two senators. Each serves for six years and has one vote. Originally, senators were not elected directly by the people, but by each State&apos;s legislature. The 17th Amendment, added in 1913, provides for the popular election of senators. Clause 2. Classification The senators elected in 1788 were divided into three groups so that the Senate could become a “continuing body.” One-third of the Senate&apos;s seats are up for election every two years. The 17th Amendment provides that a Senate vacancy is to be filled at a special election called by the governor; State law may also permit the governor to appoint a successor to serve until that election is held. Clause 3. Qualifications A senator must be at least 30 years old, a citizen for at least nine years, and must live in the State from which elected. Clause 4. Presiding officer The Vice President presides over the Senate, but may vote only to break a tie. Clause 5. Other officers The Senate chooses its own officers, including a president pro tempore to preside when the Vice President is not there. Clause 6. Impeachment trials The Senate conducts the trials of those officials impeached by the House. The Vice President presides unless the President is on trial, in which case the Chief Justice of the United States does so. A conviction requires the votes of two-thirds of the senators present. No President has ever been convicted. In 1868 the House voted eleven articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson, but the Senate fell one vote short of convicting him. In 1974 President Richard M. Nixon resigned the presidency in the face of almost certain impeachment by the House. The House brought two articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton in late 1998. Neither charge was supported by even a simple majority vote in the Senate, on February 12, 1999. Clause 7. Penalty on conviction The punishment of an official convicted in an impeachment case has always been removal from office. The Senate can also bar a convicted person from ever holding any federal office, but it is not required to do so. A convicted person can also be tried and punished in a regular court for any crime involved in the impeachment case. United States Constitution 493 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="560"> <text><![CDATA[ Section 4. Elections and Meetings Clause 1. Election In 1842 Congress required that representatives be elected from districts within each State with more than one seat in the House. The districts in each State are drawn by that State&apos;s legislature. Seven States now have only one seat in the House: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The 1842 law also directed that representatives be elected in each State on the same day: the Tuesday after the first Monday in November of every even-numbered year. In 1914 Congress also set that same date for the election of senators. Clause 2. Sessions Congress must meet at least once a year. The 20th Amendment (1933) changed the opening date to January 3. Section 5. Legislative Proceedings Clause 1. Admission of members; quorum In 1969 the Supreme Court held that the House cannot exclude any member-elect who satisfies the qualifications set out in Article I, Section 2, Clause 2. A majority in the House (218 members) or Senate (51) constitutes a quorum. In practice, both houses often pro ceed with less than a quorum present. However, any mem ber may raise a point of order (demand a “quorum call”). If a roll call then reveals less than a majority of the members present, that chamber must either adjourn or the sergeant at arms must be ordered to round up absent members. Clause 2. Rules Each house has adopted detailed rules to guide its proceedings. Each house may discipline members for unacceptable conduct; expulsion requires a two-thirds vote. Clause 3. Record Each house must keep and publish a record of its meetings. The Congressional Record is published for every day that either house of Congress is in session, and provides a written record of all that is said and done on the floor of each house each session. Clause 4. Adjournment Once in session, neither house may suspend (recess) its work for more than three days without the approval of the other house. Both houses must always meet in the same location. Section 4. 1. The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of choosing Senators. 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day. Section 5. 1. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties, as each House may provide. 2. Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member. 3. Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. 4. Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting. 494 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="561"> <text><![CDATA[ Section 6. 1. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony, and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place. 2. No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office. Section 7. 1. All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills. 2. Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve, he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of the House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sunday excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment, prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law. 3. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or, being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill. Section 6. Compensation, Immunities, and Disabilities of Members Clause 1. Salaries; immunities Each house sets its members&apos; salaries, paid by the United States; the 27th Amendment (1992) modified this pay-setting power. This provision establishes “legislative immunity.” The purpose of this immunity is to allow members to speak and debate freely in Congress itself. Treason is strictly defined in Article III, Section 3. A felony is any serious crime. A breach of the peace is any indictable offense less than treason or a felony; this exemption from arrest is of little real importance today. Clause 2. Restrictions on office holding No sitting member of either house may be appointed to an office in the executive or in the judicial branch if that position was created or its salary was increased during that member&apos;s current elected term. The second part of this clause&ndash;forbidding any person serving in either the executive or the judicial branch from also serving in Congress&ndash;reinforces the principle of separation of powers. Section 7. Revenue Bills, President&apos;s Veto Clause 1. Revenue bills All bills that raise money must originate in the House. However, the Senate has the power to amend any revenue bill sent to it from the lower house. Clause 2. Enactment of laws; veto Once both houses have passed a bill, it must be sent to the President. The President may (1) sign the bill, thus making it law; (2) veto the bill, whereupon it must be returned to the house in which it originated; or (3) allow the bill to become law without signature, by not acting upon it within 10 days of its receipt from Congress, not counting Sundays. The President has a fourth option at the end of a congressional session: If he does not act on a measure within 10 days, and Congress adjourns during that period, the bill dies; the “pocket veto” has been applied to it. A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote in each house. Clause 3. Other measures This clause refers to joint resolutions, measures Congress often passes to deal with unusual, temporary, or ceremonial matters. A joint resolution passed by Congress and signed by the President has the force of law, just as a bill does. As a matter of custom, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution is not submitted to the President for signature or veto. Concurrent and simple resolutions do not have the force of law and, therefore, are not submitted to the President. United States Constitution 495 ]]></text>

The 18 separate clauses in this section set out 27 of the many expressed powers the Constitution grants to Congress. In this clause Congress is given the power to levy and provide for the collection of various kinds of taxes, in order to finance the operations of the government. All federal taxes must be levied at the same rates throughout the country. Clause 2. Congress has power to borrow money to help finance the government. Federal borrowing is most often done through the sale of bonds on which interest is paid. The Constitution does not limit the amount the government may borrow. Clause 3. This clause, the Commerce Clause, gives Congress the power to regulate both foreign and interstate trade. Much of what Congress does, it does on the basis of its commerce power. Clause 4. Congress has the exclusive power to determine how aliens may become citizens of the United States. Congress may also pass laws relating to bankruptcy. Clause 5. has the power to establish and require the use of uniform gauges of time, distance, weight, volume, area, and the like. Clause 6. Congress has the power to make it a federal crime to falsify the coins, paper money, bonds, stamps, and the like of the United States. Clause 7. Congress has the power to provide for and regulate the transportation and delivery of mail; “post offices” are those buildings and other places where mail is deposited for dispatch; “post roads” include all routes over or upon which mail is carried. Clause 8. Congress has the power to provide for copyrights and patents. A copyright gives an author or composer the exclusive right to control the reproduction, publication, and sale of literary, musical, or other creative work. A patent gives a person the exclusive right to control the manufacture or sale of his or her invention. Clause 9. Congress has the power to create the lower federal courts, all of the several federal courts that function beneath the Supreme Court. Clause 10. Congress has the power to prohibit, as a federal crime: (1) certain acts committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and (2) the commission within the United States of any wrong against any nation with which we are at peace. Section 8. The Congress shall have Power 1. To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States; 2. To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; 3. To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; 4. To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States; 5. To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures; 6. To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States; 7. To establish Post Offices and post Roads; 8. To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing, for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries; 9. To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court; 10. To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of nations; 496 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="563"> <text><![CDATA[ 11. To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; 12. To raise and support Armies; but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years; 13. To provide and maintain a Navy; 14. To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces; 15. To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; 16. To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; 17. To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dockyards and other needful Buildings;&ndash; And 18. To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof. Section 9. 1. The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person. Clause 11. Only Congress can declare war. However, the President, as commander in chief of the armed forces (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1), can make war without such a formal declaration. Letters of marque and reprisal are commissions authorizing private persons to outfit vessels (privateers) to capture and destroy enemy ships in time of war; they were forbidden in international law by the Declaration of Paris of 1856, and the United States has honored the ban since the Civil War. Clauses 12 and 13. Congress has the power to provide for and maintain the nation&apos;s armed forces. It established the air force as an independent element of the armed forces in 1947, an exercise of its inherent powers in foreign relations and national defense. The two-year limit on spending for the army insures civilian control of the military. Clause 14. Today these rules are set out in three principle statutes: the Uniform Code of Military Justice, passed by Congress in 1950, and the Military Justice Acts of 1958 and 1983. Clauses 15 and 16. In the National Defense Act of 1916, Congress made each State&apos;s militia (volunteer army) a part of the National Guard. Today, Congress and the States cooperate in its maintenance. Ordinarily, each State&apos;s National Guard is under the command of that State&apos;s governor; but Congress has given the President the power to call any or all of those units into federal service when necessary. Clause 17. In 1791 Congress accepted land grants from Maryland and Virginia and established the District of Columbia for the nation&apos;s capital. Assuming Virginia&apos;s grant would never be needed, Congress returned it in 1846. Today, the elected government of the District&apos;s 69 square miles operates under the authority of Congress. Congress also has the power to acquire other lands from the States for various federal purposes. Clause 18. This is the Necessary and Proper Clause, also often called the Elastic Clause. It is the constitutional basis for the many and far-reaching implied powers of the Federal Government. Section 9. Powers Denied to Congress Clause 1. The phrase “such persons” referred to slaves. This provision was part of the Commerce Compromise, one of the bargains struck in the writing of the Constitution. Congress outlawed the slave trade in 1808. United States Constitution 497 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="564"> <text><![CDATA[ Clause 2. A writ of habeas corpus, the “great writ of liberty,” is a court order directing a sheriff, warden, or other public officer, or a private person, who is detaining another to “produce the body” of the one being held in order that the legality of the detention may be determined by the court. Clause 3. A bill of attainder is a legislative act that inflicts punishment without a judicial trial. See Article I, Section 10, and Article III, Section 3, Clause 2. An ex post facto law is any criminal law that operates retroactively to the disadvantage of the accused. See Article I, Section 10. Clause 4. A capitation tax is literally a “head tax,” a tax levied on each person in the population. A direct tax is one paid directly to the government by the taxpayer&ndash;for example, an income or a property tax; an indirect tax is one paid to another private party who then pays it to the government&ndash;for example, a sales tax. This provision was modified by the 16th Amendment (1913), giving Congress the power to levy “taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.” Clause 5. This provision was a part of the Commerce Compromise made by the Framers in 1787. Congress has the power to tax imported goods, however. Clause 6. All ports within the United States must be treated alike by Congress as it exercises its taxing and commerce powers. Congress cannot tax goods sent by water from one State to another, nor may it give the ports of one State any legal advantage over those of another. Clause 7. This clause gives Congress its vastly important “power of the purse,” a major check on presidential power. Federal money can be spent only in those amounts and for those purposes expressly authorized by an act of Congress. All federal income and spending must be accounted for, regularly and publicly. Clause 8. This provision, preventing the establishment of a nobility, reflects the principle that “all men are created equal.” It was also intended to discourage foreign attempts to bribe or otherwise corrupt officers of the government. Section 10. Powers Denied to the States Clause 1. The States are not sovereign governments and so cannot make agreements or otherwise negotiate with foreign states; the power to conduct foreign relations is an exclusive power of the National Government. The power to coin money is also an exclusive power of the National Government. Several powers forbidden to the National Government are here also forbidden to the States. Clause 2. This provision relates to foreign, not interstate, commerce. Only Congress, not the States, can tax imports; and the States are, like Congress, forbidden the power to tax exports. 2. The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public safety may require it. 3. No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed. 4. No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census of Enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken. 5. No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State. 6. No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear or pay Duties in another. 7. No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time. 8. No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. Section 10. 1. No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility. 2. No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws; and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Control of the Congress. 498 United States Constitution ]]></text>

No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay. Article II Section 1. 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected as follows: 2. Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit, under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. 3. The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then, the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representatives from each State having one Vote; a quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall choose from them by Ballot the Vice President. Clause 3. A duty of tonnage is a tax laid on ships according to their cargo capacity. Each State has a constitutional right to provide for and maintain a militia; but no State may keep a standing army or navy. The several restrictions here prevent the States from assuming powers that the Constitution elsewhere grants to the National Government. Executive Department Section 1. President and Vice President Clause 1. Executive power, term This clause gives to the President the very broad “executive power,” the power to enforce the laws and otherwise administer the public policies of the United States. It also sets the length of the presidential (and vice-presidential) term of office; see the 22nd Amendment (1951), which places a limit on presidential (but not vice-presidential) tenure. Clause 2. Electoral college This clause establishes the “electoral college,” although the Constitution does not use that term. It is a body of presidential electors chosen in each State, and it selects the President and Vice President every four years. The number of electors chosen in each State equals the number of senators and representatives that State has in Congress. Clause 3. Election of President and Vice President This clause was replaced by the 12th Amendment in 1804. United States Constitution 499 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="566"> <text><![CDATA[ Clause 4. Date Congress has set the date for the choosing of electors as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November every fourth year, and for the casting of electoral votes as the Monday after the second Wednesday in December of that year. Clause 5. Qualifications The President must have been born a citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for at least 14 years. Clause 6. Vacancy This clause was modified by the 25th Amendment (1967), which provides expressly for the succession of the Vice President, for the filling of a vacancy in the Vice Presidency, and for the determination of presidential inability. Clause 7. Compensation The President now receives a salary of $400,000 and a taxable expense account of $50,000 a year. Those amounts cannot be changed during a presidential term; thus, Congress cannot use the President&apos;s compensation as a bargaining tool to influence executive decisions. The phrase “any other emolument” means, in effect, any valuable gift; it does not mean that the President cannot be provided with such benefits of office as the White House, extensive staff assistance, and much else. Clause 8. Oath of office The Chief Justice of the United States regularly administers this oath or affirmation, but any judicial officer may do so. Thus, Calvin Coolidge was sworn into office in 1923 by his father, a justice of the peace in Vermont. Section 2. President&apos;s Powers and Duties Clause 1. Military, civil powers The President, a civilian, heads the nation&apos;s armed forces, a key element in the Constitution&apos;s insistence on civilian control of the military. The President&apos;s power to “require the opinion, in writing” provides the constitutional basis for the Cabinet. The President&apos;s power to grant reprieves and pardons, the power of clemency, extends only to federal cases. 4. The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States. 5. No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. 6. In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. 7. The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them. 8. Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Section 2. 1. The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. 500 United States Constitution ]]></text>

He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. 3. The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session. Section 3. He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States. Section 4. The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. Article III Section 1. The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. Clause 2. Treaties, appointments The President has the sole power to make treaties; to become effective, a treaty must be approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. In practice, the President can also make executive agreements with foreign governments; these pacts, which are frequently made and usually deal with routine matters, do not require Senate consent. The President appoints the principal officers of the executive branch and all federal judges; the “inferior officers” are those who hold lesser posts. Clause 3. Recess appointments When the Senate is not in session, appointments that require Senate consent can be made by the President on a temporary basis, as “recess appointments.” Recess appointments are valid only to the end of the congressional term in which they are made. Section 3. President&apos;s Powers and Duties The President delivers a State of the Union Message to Congress soon after that body convenes each year. That message is delivered to the nation&apos;s lawmakers and, importantly, to the American people, as well. It is shortly followed by the proposed federal budget and an economic report; and the President may send special messages to Congress at any time. In all of these communications, Congress is urged to take those actions the Chief Executive finds to be in the national interest. The President also has the power: to call special sessions of Congress; to adjourn Congress if its two houses cannot agree for that purpose; to receive the diplomatic representatives of other governments; to insure the proper execution of all federal laws; and to empower federal officers to hold their posts and perform their duties. Section 4. Impeachment The Constitution outlines the impeachment process in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 and in Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7. Judicial Department Section 1. Judicial Power, Courts, Terms of Office The judicial power conferred here is the power of federal courts to hear and decide cases, disputes between the government and individuals and between private persons (parties). The Constitution creates only the Supreme Court of the United States; it gives to Congress the power to establish other, lower federal courts (Article I, Section 8, Clause 9) and to fix the size of the Supreme Court. The words “during good Behaviour” mean, in effect, for life. United States Constitution 501 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="568"> <text><![CDATA[ Section 2. Jurisdiction Clause 1. Cases to be heard This clause sets out the jurisdiction of the federal courts; that is, it identifies those cases that may be tried in those courts. The federal courts can hear and decide&ndash;have jurisdiction over&ndash;a case depending on either the subject matter or the parties involved in that case. The jurisdiction of the federal courts in cases involving States was substantially restricted by the 11th Amendment in 1795. Clause 2. Supreme Court jurisdiction Original jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to hear a case in the first instance, not on appeal from a lower court. Appellate jurisdiction refers to a court&apos;s power to hear a case on appeal from a lower court, from the court in which the case was originally tried. This clause gives the Supreme Court both original and appellate jurisdiction. However, nearly all of the cases the High Court hears are brought to it on appeal from the lower federal courts and the highest State courts. Clause 3. Jury trial in criminal cases A person accused of a federal crime is guaranteed the right to trial by jury in a federal court in the State where the crime was committed; see the 5th and 6th amendments. The right to trial by jury in serious criminal cases in the State courts is guaranteed by the 6th and 14th amendments. Section 3. Treason Clause 1. Definition Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution. The Framers intended the very specific definition here to prevent the loose use of the charge of treason&ndash;for example, against persons who criticize the government. Treason can be committed only in time of war and only by a citizen or a resident alien. Clause 2. Punishment Congress has provided that the punishment that a federal court may impose on a convicted traitor may range from a minimum of five years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine to a maximum of death; no person convicted of treason has ever been executed by the United States. No legal punishment can be imposed on the family or descendants of a convicted traitor. Congress has also made it a crime for any person (in either peace or wartime) to commit espionage or sabotage, to attempt to overthrow the government by force, or to conspire to do any of these things. Section 2. 1. The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;&ndash; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers, and Consuls;&ndash; to all Cases of Admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;&ndash; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;&ndash; to Controversies between two or more States;&ndash; between a State and Citizens of another State;&ndash; between Citizens of different States;&ndash; between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens, or Subjects. 2. In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. 3. The trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Section 3. 1. Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. 2. The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted. 502 United States Constitution ]]></text>

And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. Section 2. 1. The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. 2. A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime. 3. No Person held to Service or Labor in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from Service or Labor, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labor may be due. Section 3. 1. New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. 2. The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence. Relations Among States Section 1. Full Faith and Credit Each State must recognize the validity of the laws, public records, and court decisions of every other State. Section 2. Privileges and Immunities of Citizens Clause 1. Residents of other States In effect, this clause means that no State may discriminate against the residents of other States; that is, a State&apos;s laws cannot draw unreasonable distinctions between its own residents and those of any of the other States. See Section 1 of the 14th Amendment. Clause 2. Extradition The process of returning a fugitive to another State is known as “interstate rendition” or, more commonly, “extradition.” Usually, that process works routinely; some extradition requests are contested how- ever&ndash;especially in cases with racial or political overtones. A governor may refuse to extradite a fugitive; but the federal courts can compel an unwilling governor to obey this constitutional command. Clause 3. Fugitive slaves This clause was nullified by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in 1865. Section 3. New States; Territories Clause 1. New States Only Congress can admit new States to the Union. A new State may not be created by taking territory from an existing State without the consent of that State&apos;s legislature. Congress has admitted 37 States since the original 13 formed the Union. Five States&ndash;Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, Maine, and West Virginia&ndash; were created from parts of existing States. Texas was an independent republic before admission. California was admitted after being ceded to the United States by Mexico. Each of the other 30 States entered the Union only after a period of time as an organized territory of the United States. Clause 2. Territory, property Congress has the power to make laws concerning the territories, other public lands, and all other property of the United States. Section 4. Protection Afforded to States by the Nation The Constitution does not define “a republican form of government,” but the phrase is generally understood to mean a representative government. The Federal Government must also defend each State against attacks from outside its border and, at the request of a State&apos;s legislature or its governor, aid its efforts to put down internal disorders.

    <page pageNumber="570"> <text><![CDATA[ Provisions for Amendment This section provides for the methods by which formal changes can be made in the Constitution. An amendment may be proposed in one of two ways: by a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress, or by a national convention called by Congress at the request of two-thirds of the State legislatures. A proposed amendment may be ratified in one of two ways: by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or by three-fourths of the States in conventions called for that purpose. Congress has the power to determine the method by which a proposed amendment may be ratified. The amendment process cannot be used to deny any State its equal representation in the United States Senate. To this point, 27 amendments have been adopted. To date, all of the amendments except the 21st Amendment were proposed by Congress and ratified by the State legislatures. Only the 21st Amendment was ratified by the convention method. National Debts, Supremacy of National Law, Oath Section 1. Validity of Debts Congress had borrowed large sums of money during the Revolution and later during the Critical Period of the 1780s. This provision, a pledge that the new government would honor those debts, did much to create confidence in that government. Section 2. Supremacy of National Law This section sets out the Supremacy Clause, a specific declaration of the supremacy of federal law over any and all forms of State law. No State, including its local governments, may make or enforce any law that conflicts with any provision in the Constitution, an act of Congress, a treaty, or an order, rule, or regulation properly issued by the President or his subordinates in the executive branch. Section 3. Oaths of Office This provision reinforces the Supremacy Clause; all public officers, at every level in the United States, owe their first allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. No religious qualification can be imposed as a condition for holding any public office. Ratification of Constitution The proposed Constitution was signed by George Washington and 37 of his fellow Framers on September 17, 1787. (George Read of Delaware signed for himself and also for his absent colleague, John Dickinson.) Article V The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate. Article VI Section 1. All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation. Section 2. This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. Section 3. The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. Article VII The ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be suf ficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the same. 504 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="572"> <text><![CDATA[ The first 10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, were each proposed by Congress on September 25, 1789, and ratified by the necessary three-fourths of the States on December 15, 1791. These amendments were originally intended to restrict the National Government&ndash;not the States. However, the Supreme Court has several times held that most of their provisions also apply to the States, through the 14th Amendment&apos;s Due Process Clause. 1st Amendment. Freedom of Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, and Petition The 1st Amendment sets out five basic liberties: The guarantee of freedom of religion is both a protection of religious thought and practice and a command of separation of church and state. The guarantees of freedom of speech and press assure to all persons a right to speak, publish, and otherwise express their views. The guarantees of the rights of assembly and petition protect the right to join with others in public meetings, political parties, interest groups, and other associations to discuss public affairs and influence public policy. None of these rights is guaranteed in absolute terms, however; like all other civil rights guarantees, each of them may be exercised only with regard to the rights of all other persons. 2nd Amendment. Bearing Arms The right of the people to keep and bear arms was insured by the 2nd Amendment. 3rd Amendment. Quartering of Troops This amendment was intended to prevent what had been common British practice in the colonial period; see the Declaration of Independence. This provision is of virtually no importance today. 4th Amendment. Searches and Seizures The basic rule laid down by the 4th Amendment is this: Police officers have no general right to search for or seize evidence or seize (arrest) persons. Except in particular circumstances, they must have a proper warrant (a court order) obtained with probable cause (on reasonable grounds). This guarantee is reinforced by the exclusionary rule, developed by the Supreme Court: Evidence gained as the result of an unlawful search or seizure cannot be used at the court trial of the person from whom it was seized. 5th Amendment. Criminal Proceedings; Due Process; Eminent Domain A person can be tried for a serious federal crime only if he or she has been indicted (charged, accused of that crime) by a grand jury. No one may be subjected to double jeopardy&ndash; that is, tried twice for the same crime. All persons are protected against self-incrimination; no person can be legally compelled to answer any question in any governmental proceeding if that answer could lead to that person&apos;s prosecution. The 5th Amendment&apos;s Due Process Clause prohibits unfair, arbitrary actions by the Federal Government; a like prohibition is set out against the States in the 14th Amendment. Government may take private property for a legitimate public purpose; but when it exercises that power of eminent domain, it must pay a fair price for the property seized. The United States Constitution Amendments 1st Amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 2nd Amendment A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 3rd Amendment. No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor, in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law. 4th Amendment. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 5th Amendment. No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War, or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 506 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="573"> <text><![CDATA[ 6th Amendment In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. 7th Amendment In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. 8th Amendment Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted. 9th Amendment The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 10th Amendment The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. 6th Amendment. Criminal Proceedings A person accused of crime has the right to be tried in court without undue delay and by an impartial jury; see Article III, Section 2, Clause 3. The defendant must be informed of the charge upon which he or she is to be tried, has the right to cross-examine hostile witnesses, and has the right to require the testimony of favorable witnesses. The defendant also has the right to be represented by an attorney at every stage in the criminal process. 7th Amendment. Civil Trials This amendment applies only to civil cases heard in federal courts. A civil case does not involve criminal matters; it is a dispute between private parties or between the government and a private party. The right to trial by jury is guaranteed in any civil case in a federal court if the amount of money involved in that case exceeds $20 (most cases today involve a much larger sum); that right may be waived (relinquished, put aside) if both parties agree to a bench trial (a trial by a judge, without a jury). 8th Amendment. Punishment for Crimes Bail is the sum of money that a person accused of crime may be required to post (deposit with the court) as a guarantee that he or she will appear in court at the proper time. The amount of bail required and/or a fine imposed as punishment must bear a reasonable relationship to the seriousness of the crime involved in the case. The prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment forbids any punishment judged to be too harsh, too severe for the crime for which it is imposed. 9th Amendment. Unenumerated Rights The fact that the Constitution sets out many civil rights guarantees, expressly provides for many protections against government, does not mean that there are not other rights also held by the people. 10th Amendment. Powers Reserved to the States This amendment identifies the area of power that may be exercised by the States. All of those powers the Constitution does not grant to the National Government, and at the same time does not forbid to the States, belong to each of the States, or to the people of each State.

Suits Against States Proposed by Congress March 4, 1794; ratified February 7, 1795, but official announcement of the ratification was delayed until January 8, 1798. This amendment repealed part of Article III, Section 2, Clause 1. No State may be sued in a federal court by a resident of another State or of a foreign country; the Supreme Court has long held that this provision also means that a State cannot be sued in a federal court by a foreign country or, more importantly, even by one of its own residents. 12th Amendment. Election of President and Vice President Proposed by Congress December 9, 1803; ratified June 15, 1804. This amendment replaced Article II, Section 1, Clause 3. Originally, each elector cast two ballots, each for a different person for President. The person with the largest number of electoral votes, provided that number was a majority of the electors, was to become President; the person with the second highest number was to become Vice President. This arrangement produced an electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr in 1800; the House finally chose Jefferson as President in 1801. The 12th Amendment separated the balloting for President and Vice President; each elector now casts one ballot for someone as President and a second ballot for another person as Vice President. Note that the 20th Amendment changed the date set here (March 4) to January 20, and that the 23rd Amendment (1961) provides for electors from the District of Columbia. This amendment also provides that the Vice President must meet the same qualifications as those set out for the President in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5. 13th Amendment. Slavery and Involuntary Servitude Proposed by Congress January 31, 1865; ratified December 6, 1865. This amendment forbids slavery in the United States and in any area under its control. It also forbids other forms of forced labor, except punishments for crime; but some forms of compulsory service are not prohibited&ndash;for example, service on juries or in the armed forces. Section 2 gives to Congress the power to carry out the provisions of Section 1 of this amendment. 11th Amendment The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State. 12th Amendment The Electors shall meet in their respective States and vote by ballot for President and Vice President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;&ndash; The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;&ndash; the person having the greatest Number of votes for President shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such a majority, then, from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice President shall act as President, as in case of death or other constitutional disability of the President. The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice President, shall be the Vice President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two thirds of the whole number of Senators, a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States. 13th Amendment Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 508 United States Constitution ]]></text>

All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two thirds of each House, remove such disability. Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void. Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. 14th Amendment. Rights of Citizens Proposed by Congress June 13, 1866; ratified July 9, 1868. Section 1 defines citizenship. It provides for the acquisition of United States citizenship by birth or by naturalization. Citizenship at birth is determined according to the principle of jus soli&ndash;“the law of the soil,” where born; naturalization is the legal process by which one acquires a new citizenship at some time after birth. Under certain circumstances, citizenship can also be gained at birth abroad, according to the principle of jus sanguinis&ndash;“the law of the blood,” to whom born. This section also contains two major civil rights provisions: the Due Process Clause forbids a State (and its local governments) to act in any unfair or arbitrary way; the Equal Protection Clause forbids a State (and its local governments) to discriminate against, draw unreasonable distinctions between, persons. Most of the rights set out against the National Government in the first eight amendments have been extended against the States (and their local governments) through Supreme Court decisions involving the 14th Amendment&apos;s Due Process Clause. The first sentence here replaced Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, the Three-Fifths Compromise provision. Essentially, all persons in the United States are counted in each decennial census, the basis for the distribution of House seats. The balance of this section has never been enforced and is generally thought to be obsolete. This section limited the President&apos;s power to pardon those persons who had led the Confederacy during the Civil War. Congress finally removed this disability in 1898. Section 4 also dealt with matters directly related to the Civil War. It reaffirmed the public debt of the United States; but it invalidated, prohibited payment of, any debt contracted by the Confederate States and also prohibited any compensation of former slave owners.

The phrase “previous condition of servitude” refers to slavery. Note that this amendment does not guarantee the right to vote to African Americans, or to anyone else. Instead, it forbids the States from discriminating against any person on the grounds of his “race, color, or previous condition of servitude” in the setting of suffrage qualifications. 16th Amendment. Income Tax Proposed by Congress July 12, 1909; ratified February 3, 1913. This amendment modified two provisions in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, and Section 9, Clause 4. It gives to Congress the power to levy an income tax, a direct tax, without regard to the populations of any of the States. 17th Amendment. Popular Election of Senators Proposed by Congress May 13, 1912; ratified April 8, 1913. This amendment repealed those portions of Article I, Section 3, Clauses 1 and 2 relating to the election of senators. Senators are now elected by the voters in each State. If a vacancy occurs, the governor of the State involved must call an election to fill the seat; the governor may appoint a senator to serve until the next election, if the State&apos;s legislature has authorized that step. 18th Amendment. Prohibition of Intoxicating Liquors Proposed by Congress December 18, 1917; ratified January 16, 1919. This amendment outlawed the making, selling, transporting, importing, or exporting of alcoholic beverages in the United States. It was repealed in its entirety by the 21st Amendment in 1933. 19th Amendment. Equal Suffrage&ndash;Sex Proposed by Congress June 4, 1919; ratified August 18, 1920. No person can be denied the right to vote in any election in the United States on account of his or her sex. 15th Amendment Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 16th Amendment The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. 17th Amendment The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures. When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct. This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution. 18th Amendment. Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited. Section 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years of the date of the submission hereof to the States by Congress. 19th Amendment The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 510 United States Constitution ]]></text>

The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin. Section 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day. Section 3. If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President-elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified. Section 4. The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them. Section 5. Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of October following the ratification of this article. Section 6. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission. 21st Amendment Section 1. The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed. Section 2. The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited. Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress. 20th Amendment. Commencement of Terms; Sessions of Congress; Death or Disqualification of President-Elect Proposed by Congress March 2, 1932; ratified January 23, 1933. The provisions of Sections 1 and 2 relating to Congress modified Article I, Section 4, Clause 2, and those provisions relating to the President, the 12th Amendment. The date on which the President and Vice President now take office was moved from March 4 to January 20. Similarly, the members of Congress now begin their terms on January 3. The 20th Amendment is sometimes called the “Lame Duck Amendment” because it shortened the period of time a member of Congress who was defeated for reelection (a “lame duck”) remains in office. This section deals with certain possibilities that were not covered by the presidential selection provisions of either Article II or the 12th Amendment. To this point, none of these situations has occurred. Note that there is neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect until the electoral votes have been counted by Congress, or, if the electoral college cannot decide the matter, the House has chosen a President or the Senate has chosen a Vice President. Congress has not in fact ever passed such a law. See Section 2 of the 25th Amendment, regarding a vacancy in the vice presidency; that provision could some day have an impact here. Section 5 set the date on which this amendment came into force. Section 6 placed a time limit on the ratification process; note that a similar provision was written into the 18th, 21st, and 22nd amendments. 21st Amendment. Repeal of 18th Amendment Proposed by Congress February 20, 1933; ratified December 5, 1933. This amendment repealed all of the 18th Amendment. Section 2 modifies the scope of the Federal Government&apos;s commerce power set out in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3; it gives to each State the power to regulate the transportation or importation and the distribution or use of intoxicating liquors in ways that would be unconstitutional in the case of any other commodity. The 21st Amendment is the only amendment Congress has thus far submitted to the States for ratification by conventions. United States Constitution 511 ]]></text>

This amendment modified Article II, Section I, Clause 1. It stipulates that no President may serve more than two elected terms. But a President who has succeeded to the office beyond the midpoint in a term to which another President was originally elected may serve for more than eight years. In any case, however, a President may not serve more than 10 years. Prior to Franklin Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms, no President had served more than two full terms in office. 23rd Amendment. Presidential Electors for the District of Columbia Proposed by Congress June 16, 1960; ratified March 29, 1961. This amendment modified Article II, Section I, Clause 2 and the 12th Amendment. It included the voters of the District of Columbia in the presidential electorate; and provides that the District is to have the same number of electors as the least populous State&ndash;three electors&ndash;but no more than that number. 24th Amendment. Right to Vote in Federal Elections&ndash;Tax Payment Proposed by Congress August 27, 1962; ratified January 23, 1964. This amendment outlawed the payment of any tax as a condition for taking part in the nomination or election of any federal officeholder. 25th Amendment. Presidential Succession, Vice Presidential Vacancy, Presidential Inability Proposed by Congress July 6, 1965; ratified February 10, 1967. Section 1 revised the imprecise provision on presidential succession in Article II, Section 1, Clause 6. It affirmed the precedent set by Vice President John Tyler, who became President on the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841. Section 2 provides for the filling of a vacancy in the office of Vice President. The office had been vacant on 16 occasions and remained unfilled for the rest of each term involved. When Spiro Agnew resigned the office in 1973, President Nixon selected Gerald Ford per this provision; and, when President Nixon resigned in 1974, Gerald Ford became President and chose Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President. 22nd Amendment Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President, when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term. Section 2. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress. 23rd Amendment. Section 1. The District constituting the seat of Government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct: A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment. 24th Amendment. Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax. Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 25th Amendment. Section 1. In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President. Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress. 512 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="579"> <text><![CDATA[ Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President. Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office. 26th Amendment. Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age. Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 27th Amendment. No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened. This section created a procedure for determining if a President is so incapacitated that he cannot perform the powers and duties of his office. Section 4 deals with the circumstance in which a President will not be able to determine the fact of incapacity. To this point, Congress has not established the “such other body” referred to here. This section contains the only typographical error in the Constitution; in its second paragraph, the word “department” should in fact read “departments.” 26th Amendment. Right to Vote&ndash;Age Proposed by Congress March 23, 1971; ratified July 1, 1971. This amendment provides that the minimum age for voting in any election in the United States cannot be more than 18 years. (A State may set a minimum voting age of less than 18, however.) 27th Amendment. Congressional Pay Proposed by Congress September 25, 1789; ratified May 7, 1992. This amendment modified Article I, Section 6, Clause 1. It limits Congress&apos;s power to fix the salaries of its members&ndash; by delaying the effectiveness of any increase in that pay until after the next regular congressional election.

Starting with its preamble, the document spells out all the reasons the people of the United States have the right to break away from Britain. Primary Source The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&apos;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel [force] them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed [gifted] by their Creator with certain unalienable [cannot be taken away] Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence [cautiousness], indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations [unjust uses of power], pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism [rule of absolute power], it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish [give up] the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable [priceless] to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions [closing down], to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions [riots] within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure [term] of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. 514 Primary Sources ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="581"> <text><![CDATA[ He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering [lodging] large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries [soldiers] to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy [dishonesty] scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress [correction of wrongs] in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity [generosity], and we have conjured [begged] them by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity [relation by blood]. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude [justness] of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor. ASSESSMENT 1. Identify Cause and Effect How might the ideas about equality expressed in the Declaration of Independence have influenced later historical movements, such as the abolitionist movement and the women&apos;s suffrage movement? 2. Identify Key Steps in a Process Why was the Declaration of Independence a necessary document for the founding of the new nation? 3. Draw Inferences English philosopher John Locke wrote that government should protect “life, liberty, and estate.” How do you think Locke&apos;s writing influenced ideas about government put forth in the Declaration of Independence? 4.

A great many high school students do not think much about their financial future. They also don&apos;t like to get stern lectures from Mom or Dad&ndash;whether it&apos;s about financial planning or about those 5,000 extra text messages that appeared on last month&apos;s cellphone bill. But let&apos;s face it: free room and board doesn&apos;t last forever. And often, it comes to an end soon after you get handed a diploma. At some point in the not-too-distant future, the bills in the mail will be yours. The fact is that responsible financial citizens were not born that way. Even your parents had to learn how to comparison shop, avoid impulse buying, and put money aside that they would much rather spend on fun. Chances are they made mistakes along the way. And they wish you could avoid all the same pitfalls. Take a Checkup Start by taking a good look at your own money habits. Are you a big spender? Moderate saver? Do you save anything at all? The answer is pretty easy to figure out. If you have an unexpected windfall, a bigger than expected birthday check, or an opportunity to earn extra money, what do you do with the money? Save it all? Save half? Look to see what you can buy now? Skip the Fats, Go for the Protein! It comes down to fiscal fitness. Developing a solid, fiscal muscle also involves training or budgeting, short- and long-term goal setting, and most of all, patience. Personal finance, like athletics, requires discipline. << One way to be financially responsible is to look for sales. Comparison shopping can help people find the best deals and work towards meeting a budget. 516 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="583"> <text><![CDATA[ Preparing for a long race often involves delayed gratification. An athlete will sacrifice fast-food because it&apos;s bad for his health, and healthy eating will pay off in the long run. The same is true of investing in your future. It may mean putting off purchases today for financial security sometime later on. That&apos;s easy to say but hard to do, especially if you want to keep up with your peers. You and your dollars are the target of marketers and advertisers. According to a national survey, teenagers are rabid consumers of high-tech products. About 75 percent of U.S. teenagers own a cellphone, 60 percent have an MP3 player, and 43 percent have a car. The Long Race The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. The impulse to get what we want now is far stronger than the motivation to save for something that is months or even years down the road. You may have to trick yourself into saving by promising yourself a reward when you have met certain goals. Obstacles What could slow down your progress? One outstanding speed bump is credit card abuse. You don&apos;t want to join the ranks of those who struggle to pay their credit card balance in full every month. They let matters slide&ndash;failing to balance their checkbooks, check their credit card statements, or keep an eye on bank fees and interest rates. You want to develop the fiscal awareness that will keep you out of trouble. Grow Your Money Despite the difficulty of thinking long-term, 65 percent of teens actually admit that they want to learn how to grow their money. This is good news. Even better, 84 percent of teens have savings, with an average amount of $1,044. Fueling those savings is their attitude that the future is now. Savings could translate into a car and college in the short run and a secure life and retirement in the years to come. With the right attitude, you&apos;re ready for basic training. In no time at all, the following words will be part of your conversation. Budgeting&ndash;how to spend your income in such a way that there&apos;s something left over to invest. Compound- ing&ndash;how saving a little now can translate into big money later on in life. Investing&ndash;why the stock market can be both friend and foe.

The word may conjure up images of driving a junk car or eating canned spaghetti every night. But the reality can be just the opposite. In fact, most millionaires use a budget to manage their money. And most of them started early. Average American Family Budget Housing Transportation Food Insurance and Pensions Other Healthcare Entertainment Apparel Cash Contributions 13% 11% 7% 7% 5% 3%4% 34% 16% SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Expenditures, 2010 << Budgets can vary based on lifestyle and income. Developing a budget that includes all of the categories of spending will help determine how much money to set aside for each category. Spending Awareness Surveys show that almost one half of Americans between the ages of 13 and 18 know how to budget their money. That&apos;s the good news. The bad news is more than half don&apos;t. Which group do you fall into? Take this quick quiz: &bull; How much money did you spend on beverages&ndash;from coffee or water to energy drinks&ndash;last week? &bull; How much money will you spend on gas next week? &bull; How long will it take you to save up for the most expensive thing you&apos;d like to buy? If you answered these questions without much trouble, you&apos;ve already taken the first steps to good money management. If you don&apos;t have a clue, maybe it&apos;s time to think about making a budget. Good Habits Start Early Now here&apos;s another question. Did you ever ask for money to spend on concert tickets&ndash;or a piece of jewelry, or a ski trip&ndash;only to hear “You don&apos;t need it, and we can&apos;t afford it”? Odds are you didn&apos;t think of it as an economics lesson. But according to surveys, students who learned about money management at home scored higher than those who learned about it only in school. 518 Personal Finance ]]></text>

Identify needs Identify needs: bills, car payment, etc. Spend wisely Downsize or eliminate impulse buys such as coffee and soda. Prioritize saving Make saving a priority and a habit. Save weekly Add to your savings weekly, even if just a small amount. Plan for the long-term Identify a long-term want and start saving for it. (You&apos;ll be surprised how fast those fast-food outings diminish when you set your mind on something.) Pay down debt Prioritize and pay down any outstanding debt&ndash;including that $5 you owe your sister. Use cash Use cash for daily spending. Work more During vacations or the summer, pick up some extra hours at work. Spend less Live within your means. Spend less than you make. >> Be budget smart! Follow these tips to stay on track with your spending and saving. Income and Expenses Budgeting is a balancing act between income and expenses. It also means weighing your needs against your wants. To begin creating a budget, follow these steps in order. &bull; Make a list of your earnings per month from all sources. Add these up to calculate your expected monthly income. &bull; For one month, keep a record of everything you spend, from chewing gum to car payments. Collect receipts or write everything in a notebook. Make sure you don&apos;t leave anything out. (And that includes savings!) &bull; At the end of the month, organize your spending into categories such as food, entertainment, and car payments. Total the amount in each category. &bull; On a sheet of paper, list your income and expenses. If your total expenses are less than your total income, you&apos;re doing fine. If not, you need to take a hard look at where your money is going. Needs and Wants Right now, many of your basic needs are probably part of the household budget. Still, some of your personal funds may be going toward needs such as car insurance, lunches, or college savings. So, if you are looking to cut down expenses, you should focus first on the wants. Consider the example of Michelle, a high school senior. She works 20 hours a week at a department store, where she earns $10.00 an hour. Her net income&ndash;that is, her take- home pay after taxes&ndash;is $150. Her monthly necessities include $40 for her cellphone bill, $60 on average for gas, and $65 a month on car insurance. Michelle has already set aside $300 a month for her prom and hopes to have $500 by the time prom rolls around. To stay within her budget, she gives up her daily soda habit, saving almost $30 a month. She and her friends also decide to watch movies at home rather than go out. This trade-off will allow them to rent a limousine to go to their prom. Michelle has planned for a long-term goal and budgeted correctly. She has drawn a fine line between needs and wants. Personal Finance 519 ]]></text>

Try not to rationalize impulse buys. Consider them your sworn budget enemies! Long-Term Rewards Err on the side of thrift and responsibility. Live within your means and try to save a set percentage of your income. Some budget counselors suggest allotting 80 percent for needs, 10 percent for wants, and 10 percent for savings. Do that and you might find yourself with a tidy savings within a few short years. Spend without a plan and you might end up like many Americans: deep in debt. In fact, U.S. consumer debt topped an estimated 11.52 trillion dollars in 2013. About $820 billion, or 7.1 percent of outstanding debt is in some stage of delinquency, or late payment, with $580 billion over 90 days late in payment. The 90-day delinquency rate on credit card balances was 9.5 percent of the total credit card debt in 2013, while 11.5 percent of student loans in 2013 were in 90-day delinquency or in default. Learning to budget now may spare you from being part of this grim statistic later. Checking The Right Bank Banks are everywhere. Often they face each other at busy intersections in a community or are tucked in the corner of a supermarket. Every bank is vying for your business. How do you choose among them? You want to use a bank that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC protects your money and the interest it has earned&ndash;up to the insurance limit&ndash;in the event that your bank fails. For an account held by a single individual, the limit was raised to $250,000 in 2008. Banks are generally considered to be financially sound, but failures do occur. << Banks offer FDIC services. 520 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="587"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance 521 Endless Variety It may be impossible for you to believe, but not so very long ago even the biggest cities offered only ten different television stations. That was it for choices. The services offered by banks have grown in a similar way to the expansion of TV enter- tainment options. Although banks may look very similar, their services are not one-size- fits-all. The bank that is most convenient for you meets your needs. First, you have to figure out what you want and then figure out where to get it. Checking Accounts One universal need is convenient and safe access to your money. Checking accounts and debit cards have made both readily available. To open a check- ing account you will need identification, such as a birth certificate or a driver&apos;s license and a Social Security number. You will also need money to deposit. Which checking account meets your needs? Basic checking: Best bet for customers who use a checking account to pay some bills and use a debit card for some daily expenses. Drawback: Monthly maintenance fees may apply unless you retain a minimum balance or enroll in direct deposit. Some banks may limit the number of checks you can write each month and charge you a per-item fee if you exceed the limit. Free checking: The operative word here is “free,” meaning a no-strings attached account with no monthly service charges or per-item fees, regardless of the balance or activity. Drawback: These are harder to find and the “free” part may be an introductory offer that expires in six months or a year. Checking with overdraft protection: In effect, if you write checks for more than the balance of your deposits, the bank will honor the check by lending you the money you need, up to a preset limit. Drawback: This service comes with hefty fees. >> To avoid problems with checks: 1. Write clearly. 2. Do not cross out or write over a mistake. 3. Tear a check with any errors into small pieces and write “Void” next to the check number in your check register. 4. NEVER write a check for more than your account balance. ________________ Use words to write the payment amount. Write the name of the payee. Write the current date. Sign your check. Use numerals to enter the payment amount. Write additional information about the payment or payee, such as a reason or an account number. ________________ Use words to write the payment amount.

    <page pageNumber="588"> <text><![CDATA[ The Debit Card Most banks offer you a debit card with a checking account. With a credit card logo, it has the look and feel of a credit card, but there is a major difference. The money you spend is deducted from your checking account balance. Debit cards are also used to withdraw money from ATMs, giving you access to your money 24/7. If you use an ATM from a bank other than your own, you will likely be charged a fee. You could pay $2 to get access to your own $20. Debit cards are convenient, but convenience comes with a price. Direct Deposit Banks and employers encourage people to take advantage of direct deposit. A win-win for you and the environment, the paperless transaction enlists your employer to deposit your paycheck directly into your bank account. An employer may ask for your Social Security number, a voided check containing your bank&apos;s routing number, and your account number. Keeping Track When you open a checking account, you will receive a checkbook that includes sequentially numbered checks and a check register, or a booklet in which you&apos;ll record your account transactions. Every time you write a check, make a deposit, or use an ATM, you should take a few seconds towrite it down. It is also important to hold onto your ATM receipts. They are the only proof that you withdrew $40, not $400. Each month the bank will send you a statement of the activity on your account. If you opt to do your banking online, you can access your statement electronically. Your statement lists deposits, withdrawals, ATM transactions, interest paid, and fees charged. You will get a photocopy of any checks that were cashed during that month. Reconcile your bank statement by comparing the transactions on the bank statement to your own records to make sure they agree. By taking a little time to be a good record keeper, you will make life a lot easier and protect yourself from mistakes and fraud. For more banking tips, check out fdic.gov. Online Banking Once upon a time, people had to go to the bank to deposit money, to transfer money from one account to another, or to withdraw money from an account. They had to write a check or use cash to pay bills. This has become ancient history. The online bank is growing fast in popularity. An online bank can be a virtual extension of a brick-and-mortar bank or can exist solely in cyberspace. As long as a bank is insured by the FDIC, deposits are safe up to $250,000. Online Banking Tips Make sure your computer is protected with the latest versions of antivirus and antispyware software. When banking online, ALWAYS double-check the Web site. When creating a password, avoid the obvious, including first names, birthdays, anniversaries, or Social Security numbers. Change passwords on a routine basis. Make sure all other browser windows are closed during your transaction. Exit a banking site after completing your online transactions and empty your computer&apos;s cache. Use Paypal. If your bank doesn&apos;t offer online bill pay, this online escrow service distributes your money fee-free to registered clients.

Internet banks also offer the environmentally friendly option to stop paper records, allowing you to access your statements, canceled checks, and notices online only. Your can even arrange automatic bill payment. Although you receive a bill in the mail or in your e-mail, the amount you owe is automatically deducted from your bank account on a predetermined date. You save time, postage, and the possibility of missing a payment and incurring late fees. There can be other financial advantages to using online banks. Internet bank fees can be as much as 80 percent less than those charged by traditional banks. They may also offer checking, savings, or money market and CD accounts that yield higher interest rates than those offered by traditional banks. A major benefit to the consumer is the ability to find these good deals by comparison shopping online. In the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, “A penny saved is a penny earned.” By getting in the habit of looking for the lowest interest rates on loans and the highest interest rates on savings, the wise consumer will slowly pull ahead of the pack. Add a little compound interest into the mix and the pace of progress will pick up. >> Depositing checks into a savings or checking account using a mobile device is a beneficial service that many people prefer. Be Responsible Even though you may choose to bank online, every month you will get a statement in the mail from your financial institution. It is your responsibility to check this against your online transactions and report any discrepancies to your bank. Laws regulating an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), a system for transferring money from one bank to another, protect you in the case of fraud. You, however, have to do your part. In order to be protected by the law, you must report any errors in transactions within 60 days of the receipt of your bank statement. No matter how careful banks are not to make errors, no one is perfect. If you use automatic bill pay, it is your responsibility to have sufficient funds in the account to cover the transaction. Some procedures of online banking are still affected by Personal Finance 523 ]]></text>

If you are transferring funds to cover your bills, the money may not show up in your account unless you have made the transfer the previous day before a specific cutoff time. A deposit made at 1 a.m. may not show up on your account until the next business day. Plan your transactions accordingly, particularly if you wait until the last moment to pay your bills. Gone Phishing Phishing is a scam in which a fraudulent Web site is used to gain personal and financial data to commit fraud. It&apos;s good to examine the risks of using a computer to maintain accounts at financial institutions. There are several steps you can take to protect yourself. &bull; Online banking transactions should be done through the bank&apos;s Web site only. &bull; Never respond to e-mails from your “alleged” bank that request sensitive personal or financial information. &bull; If you suspect fraud, contact your bank by phone to determine if it&apos;s a legitimate communication from the bank. If not, alert them to the scam. If you think you can&apos;t be fooled, think again. Phishing techniques can be highly elaborate. Many even set up mirror Web pages intended to look like your financial institution&apos;s Web site to earn your trust. Traditional Banking In the balance, why would anyone still use a brick-andmortar bank? There are a number of reasons that make some consumers reluctant to drop traditional banking altogether. While Internet-only banks receive high marks for convenience, they also can be inconvenient. &bull; To fund an account, you will have to mail in a check, arrange for direct deposit, or make a transfer from another bank. This is not a problem, of course, with banks that also operate a physical branch. &bull; Not having the option of being able to speak with someone face-to-face is another inconvenience. Some customers prefer to interact with people who know them personally. Making a phone call or communicating by e-mail is not to everyone&apos;s liking. &bull; Another drawback is the difficulty of finding fee-free ATMs, although online banks often have ATM networks for their customers to use at minimal cost. << ATM machines are a banking convenience that usually charge a small transaction fee. 524 Personal Finance ]]></text>

More than 80 percent of millionaires are self-made, first-generation rich. But forget the lottery and other get-rich-quick schemes. You have to set your own goals and work toward them. Pay Yourself First In order to get started on your road to wealth, you have to remember one simple rule: Pay yourself first. A good rule of thumb is to set aside 10 to 15 percent of your income. We will talk later about how to achieve this goal, but for the time being, accept the fact. The lifestyle you choose to live now will determine the lifestyle you will be able to have in the future. But, don&apos;t forget others, as well. Charitable giving to organizations working to help the less fortunate are good investments in everyone&apos;s future. Get Help From Interest Let&apos;s assume that you have made the decision to save. The positive news is that your savings will work for you. Banks pay you interest for using your money. Interest rates are expressed as percentages and indicate how much money an account will earn on funds deposited for a full year. Interest is compounded when it is added to your principal and you earn interest on both amounts. In effect, compound interest is interest on interest. Most first-generation millionaires acquire their wealth over a lifetime. Their road to riches has more to do with budgeting, compound interest, and careful investing than with salary and inheritances. Basic Investing Putting money in a savings account is very safe. The only danger to money in a savings account is that the rate of inflation will be greater than the interest rate. Over time, the money in your savings account could lose value&ndash;it will buy less and less. But you will never lose your principal, the amount of money you put in the account. Investing money is not the same as “saving” money. Investors take more risk&ndash;even possibly losing money&ndash;in the hopes of getting a higher return on their money. Investing your money can give your dollars a greater opportunity to grow. Bonds, stocks, and mutual funds are among the many investment choices that you have. Of course, with the possibility of greater growth comes the possibility of greater loss. If you invest in a corporate bond, stock, or mutual fund, you stand the risk of losing some or all of the money you invested. This risk is offset by the possibility of greater gain, allowing your money to grow at a faster rate than the rate of inflation. Personal Finance 525 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="592"> <text><![CDATA[ The Name Is Bond A bond is an IOU issued by a corporation or by some level of government. When you buy a bond, you are lending money in return for a guaranteed payout at some later date. The safest bonds to buy are government-issued bonds because it is unlikely that a government will go bankrupt. You can get U.S. government bonds through your bank, and they can be bought in small denominations. Many corporate bonds carry a low-to-moderate risk to investors and take anywhere from 5 to 30 years to mature. The value of some bonds varies. For example, if you buy a bond when interest rates are 6 percent but you want to sell it before it matures, then the bond&apos;s value will be affected by current interest rates. If rates have gone up since you bought the bond, then you will have to discount the price to sell it. Why else would anyone want it, if they could get a higher rate of interest elsewhere? But, if interest rates have gone down, then that 6 percent rate will seem much more inviting. In this case, you could sell the bond for more than you paid for it. Because the value of bonds is relatively stable, they are a good investment for people who cannot tolerate much risk. Families saving to send children to college may find bonds attractive because they generally earn higher interest than a savings account and aren&apos;t likely to fall sharply in value the way stocks can. Stock Up Stocks represent ownership in a public company. If you buy shares in a corporation, you become a part owner. You will make money if the price of the stock goes up and if you receive dividends, which are a portion of the profits paid to the owners. There are two kinds of stock, preferred stock and common stock. Preferred stock holders get a set dividend and are paid from the corporate profits before the common stock holders. Stocks are generally a riskier investment than bonds. Historically, however, stocks have rewarded their owners with higher returns than bonds or savings accounts. By knowing about the types of stocks, understanding how returns are generated, and weighing the risk factors, you can assess ways to be a wise investor in the stock market. Stock markets are a reflection of the sum of the buying and selling of all stocks in that market. Investors use what they know about the companies, industries, business in general, and the events happening in the world to make their buying and selling decisions. Investing is tied directly to what is known about the investments. Investors are, however, just people, and people do not always act rationally nor do they always have all the information they need to make a decision. Many investors make poor decisions because they don&apos;t consider their own biases, like being more influenced by losses in the values of their investments than by the gains, or in investing in the familiar, like family businesses or domestic stocks rather than international stocks. To be a smart investor you should learn as much as you can about your investments and learn about human nature to avoid costly mistakes. 526 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="593"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance 527 What About Mutual Funds? A mutual fund is an investment in a company that buys and sells stocks and bonds in other companies. By combining your money with that of other investors, the managers of the mutual fund can buy a wide variety of stocks and bonds. When you buy a mutual fund, you are buying a part ownership of the stocks or bonds owned by the investment company. The biggest advantage of investing in this way is that you instantly have a diversified portfolio. Your risk is spread out. Three kinds of mutual funds have three levels of risk. &bull;Money market funds, which are not the same as money market accounts, are short-term, low-risk investments. The money you invest is used to make short- term loans to businesses or governments. &bull;Bond funds are investments in bonds. Though riskier than money market funds, they have a higher potential return. &bull;Stock funds are made up of a variety of stocks. Over the long term, they have provided higher returns than either market funds or bond funds. Mutual fund companies are required by law to register reports and statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You can check up on them through the SEC&apos;s data- base at www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/mutualsearch.htm. Morningstar and Standard and Poors are two companies that rate mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and other investments. Investment Strategy Many first-time investors think that the way to make money is to buy low and sell high. But, trying to time the stock market has proven elusive to even the most savvy investor. When all is said and done, it&apos;s best to use common sense.

The Case for Dollar Cost Averaging SHARES YOU BUY January$1050February862.5March683.3April862.5May1050TOTAL308.3PRICE PER SHAREMONTH >> Let&apos;s say you put $500 a month into a mutual fund each month for 5 months. The price of a share goes from $5 to $10. You own 308.3 shares, worth $3,083. You invested $2,500 over 5 months. You made $583 at an average price per share of $8.40. Other Options The risk and payout on investments covers a range from the most secure to the very, very risky. Junk bonds didn&apos;t get their name because they were a secure place to park money. Some people invest in collectibles&ndash;fine art, baseball cards, Civil War memorabilia. If the market remains strong, people who can part with what they have bought stand to make a lot of money. But, if no one is interested in your stamp collection, you may end up using it for postage. What you choose depends on the risk you are willing to accept. You also need to consider the length of your investments and any tax burdens the investment may carry. If your scheme is to count on “sure things” or use tips from the cousin of your neighbor&apos;s son-in-law, you are likely to be very disappointed. The Risk Pyramid High Risk: Moderate Risk: Low Risk: penny stocks, art, collectibles, commodities real estate, mutual funds, stocks, corporate bonds U.S. savings bonds, treasury bonds, money markets, checking and savings accounts, CDs, cash >> “Risk” means the danger that an investment will disappoint you. A pyramid is sometimes used to demonstrate the riskiness of various investments. At the top are very risky investments like futures in precious metals. At the bottom are the least risky investments like savings accounts. 528 Personal Finance ]]></text>

Even though the government taxes interest and dividends at the same rate as earned income, the profits from the sale of stocks or property are capital gains. In recent years, the taxes on long-term capital gains have been lower than the tax rate on the interest from bonds and savings accounts. As an added bonus, interest earned on U.S. government bonds is exempt from state and local taxes. What it comes down to in the end is that informed decisions and careful planning are your best strategies for successful investment. Portfolios: Where do you stand?

On his list of people to pay, Ricky has left someone out. He has forgot- ten to pay himself. Get in the Habit What does it mean to pay yourself first? It simply means to make personal savings a regular part of your budget, just like rent and food. Everyone has the potential to save, even if it means sacrificing a few immediate wants. You&apos;d be surprised where the savings can come from. Cut out the daily $2.00 for soft drinks at the vending machine, and you&apos;ve just saved $14 a week. Multiply that by 52, and you&apos;ve pocketed a tidy sum in just one year. Saving is a habit and takes discipline. You can get into the habit of saving money every month by taking a percentage of your monthly income and then paying yourself first. For example, you can have your employer automatically deposit a certain amount into your savings account. But don&apos;t touch it! People who have trouble saving manage their money in reverse. They spend first, and then save what is left. But what if there&apos;s nothing left? Then there&apos;s nothing left to save. Saving doesn&apos;t mean you don&apos;t get to spend your money. It means you get to spend it later. Why Save? Not many young people think about saving for retirement. (“Retirement? I haven&apos;t even started working!”) Yet, when it comes to saving, time is money. There are at least three big benefits to thinking now about the day you finally stop working. The big- gest benefit is compound interest.

    <page pageNumber="597"> <text><![CDATA[ The Magic of Compound Interest The earlier you start saving, the faster your money will grow. The reason: compound interest. Compound interest is interest you earn, not only on the money you put into an account, but also on all the interest you have previously built up. Today&apos;s interest earnings will start earning interest tomorrow. The more you save today, the more interest you will gain tomorrow. And that savings will add up at a faster rate. For every year that you put off saving, you could lose thousands of dollars in the long haul. Other Benefits There are also big tax benefits when you stash money away for retirement. If you put funds into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), the money may escape taxation until you retire&ndash;or at least until you reach age 59 1/2. That cuts your tax bill NOW. Even better, when you withdraw your money from a special IRA (called a Roth IRA), the money you make&ndash;the appreciation&ndash;may not be taxed at all. You can also see the value of setting up a savings and investment plan early when you look at the time value of money. If you think about a target value you want for your savings or investments, you&apos;re thinking about that money in future terms, say, $100,000 10 years from now. To understand the value of that $100,000 today, how much you would need to invest now to reach that goal over a specific number of years at a particular interest rate, you have to discount that future value of $100,000 based on the rate of return or interest your investment or savings will make over that period of time. Let&apos;s say you have a goal of having $50,000 saved in 10 years by putting your money into an investment that will have a 5% rate of return over that 10 years. To determine how much money you need to put into that investment today, the present value of that $50,000, you would divide the future value of your money ($50,000) by the sum of 1 plus the rate of return (0.05, which is 5% expressed as a decimal) raised to the number of years of the investment as an exponent&ndash;(1+ rate of return)number of years of investment. For our example, that looks like $50,000 ÷ 1.0510 = $30,695.75. This tells us that the present value of our future $50,000 is $30,695.75&ndash;meaning, if we want to have $50,000 after 10 years of earning a 5% rate of return then today we would have to invest $30,695.75. Finally, putting money away now allows you to have a cushion in case of emergencies. There are even circumstances in which&ndash;despite the government&apos;s restrictions&ndash;you can dip into a retirement fund to pay for other expenses. For example, you can access some retirement accounts to buy your first house or to cover high medical expenses. Whether your dream is a comfortable retirement, a nice home, or foreign travel, you&apos;re going to need a savings plan to make it come true. As you&apos;ll see, there are many options to choose from. But it all starts with developing a saving habit&ndash;with paying yourself first. Three Savers Okay, so you&apos;ve decided to take a portion of your income every week and put it towards your financial future. Your goal is to achieve financial freedom, meet emergencies, and have a comfortable retirement&ndash;maybe even to “get rich.” But not all paths are equal. Different “Plans” Let&apos;s look at three young adults: Amanda, Tyler, and A.J. Each of them is making about the same amount of money. Each of them decides to take $10 per week and dedicate it to their financial future. Amanda takes her $10 and puts it in a shoebox under her bed. Tyler takes his $10 and puts it in a simple savings account paying 3.6 percent interest. A.J. takes his $10 and invests in lottery tickets in the hopes of winning a million dollars.

    <page pageNumber="598"> <text><![CDATA[ Different Results Each of the three keeps this up regularly for 20 years. Each of them would say, “I&apos;m paying myself first.” But see how different the results are: &bull; Amanda has paid herself a total of $10,400. She now has $10,400. &bull; Tyler has paid himself a total of $10,400. He now has $15,392. &bull; A.J. has paid himself a total of $10,400. He now has $0. The fact is, the odds of winning a state lottery are something like one in 18 million. So what sounds better to you? A 100 percent chance of increasing your savings by nearly $5,000 ... or a 99.99999995 percent chance of losing it all? That&apos;s a no-brainer. Tyler&apos;s savings account is also clearly more profitable than Amanda&apos;s shoebox. But even the savings account may not be the best option of all. Park Your Savings In making a personal savings plan, the first question you have to ask yourself is: How much can I save? You&apos;ve seen how putting aside even a small amount can build up as long as you do it regularly. The amount you save per week should be one that you can reasonably commit to for a year. The key to success is that you must do this even if you cannot afford it. Then, pay your other bills as usual. Savings Account Usually, saving starts with setting up a basic savings account carrying no monthly fee. But when choosing a place to park your savings, shop around. Make sure the bank is FDIC insured. Some banks will charge you excessive fees just for the privilege of having your money. Web sites such as bankrate.com show you what interest rate different banks are currently paying for checking accounts. Interest rates for savings and investments can be expressed in different ways that tell you different things. The nominal interest rate tells you how the dollar value of your savings or investment will grow over time. The real interest rate tells you how the purchasing power of your savings or investment will grow over time when factoring in inflation in the economy over the same period of time. CDs Once you start making more money, think about moving some cash into a certificate of deposit, or CD. Like a savings account, a CD is insured and therefore very low- risk. But CDs generally offer higher interest than a savings account. The catch is, once you put your money in, you can&apos;t take it out for a fixed period of time. Depending on the length of the CD, you would have to part company with your money for as little as three months or as long as five years. There are penalty fees for early withdrawal. As with savings accounts, you can compare CD rates online. You might even opt for an online bank that offers even higher interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks. Here are the details for one available CD: &bull; Initial Deposit: $1,000 &bull; Length of CD: 1 year, 6 months (18 months) &bull; Interest Rate: 4% compounded daily &bull; Annual Percentage Yield (APY): 4.081% &bull; Ending Balance: $1,061.83 Money Markets What if you want a higher yield than a regular savings account without tying up your money? You might open a money market account. This is a type of savings account with a high yield that allows you to write checks as long as you maintain a high balance in the account. So which is the best plan? It all depends on how much you can afford to put aside, and whether high yield is more important to you than easy access to your money. 532 Personal Finance ]]></text>

With so much on your mind now, why would you even think about retirement? The answer is simple. You will have to live later with the consequences of your decisions now. Most people on the brink of retirement today will tell you that they wished they had known then what they know now. It is never too early to plan for retirement. The longer you wait to save, the less time your money has to work for you. If you have a job now, you&apos;re already putting some money away for retirement. The government takes money from your paycheck to save for your future in the form of the FICA tax, or Social Security tax. But experts generally agree that Social Security payments alone will not fund a comfortable retirement. How Much Will You Need? How much money will you need in retirement? That depends on mountains of variables&ndash;your health, your lifestyle, where you live. Everybody has different needs. Let&apos;s look at some current, general estimates. Many financial advisers estimate that you will need 70 percent of your pre-retirement income in order to retire comfortably. By comfortably they mean you will be able to keep up your pre-retirement lifestyle. Your needs are lower because you do not have to buy clothes for work or pay for commuting and eating out. You also won&apos;t have to put as much money into your retirement investments. It is time for them to pay you. No one is average, however. Some people spend more money when they first retire because they have more time for travel and entertainment. As they age, they travel less, and those costs go down. But, in many cases the cost of healthcare goes up. Where Does the Money Come From? The first source is Social Security. You might also have a defined pension, a set amount of money paid by your employer based on your wages and length of employment. Defined pensions, however, are disappearing in private industry. The rest of your retirement income depends on you: a 401(k), Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), investments, and savings. Social Security Each year the Social Security Administration sets the minimum amount of earnings you need to have to be entitled to Social Security benefits. You can begin to collect reduced benefits at age 62 and full benefits at age 67 for people born after 1959. As the population ages, the point will come when Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it collects each year in payroll taxes. There is a lively debate in progress about Personal Finance 533 ]]></text>

The message here is that you have to prepare to take care of yourself. << Social Security can offer funds to help with expenses for seniors. 401(k) This leads us to the 401(k). You want to pay attention to this retirement plan. The law allows you to set aside a portion of your pay before taxes are withheld. Rent, credit cards, and student loans may limit what you can contribute to your 401(k), but the returns are worth the sacrifice. Some employers match every dollar you save up to three percent of your salary. Others may choose to contribute 50 cents per dollar you save, up to six percent of your salary. Either way, you get an immediate return on your money and you don&apos;t pay taxes on any of it until you withdraw it years later. Employers have come to realize that many people do not have a clue how to invest the money in their 401(k) accounts. More and more employers are providing sources of investment advice to their employees to help them make the most of their money. Other Accounts The federal government also encourages you to save for retirement by providing special tax advantages for other retirement accounts. You can open up a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) at a bank and contribute $5,000 per year. Depending on your income, this money may be tax deductible. You have to be ready to leave this money alone. Tapping an IRA prior to age 59 1/2 will cost you dual penalties. You will forfeit 10 percent of your interest, plus pay taxes on what you have withdrawn as though it were added income. The 10 percent penalty is waived if the money is used for higher education or first-time home ownership. In a ROTH IRA, contributions are taxed prior to investing but withdrawals after age 59 1/2 are tax free, meaning you never pay taxes on the interest or dividends that have accumulated over the years. Roth IRA money may be withdrawn for first-time homeowners or higher education on the condition that the account has been open for 5 years. Early withdrawals will be subject to the 10 percent penalty. Federal regulations regarding these kinds of accounts are subject to change by Congress. In recent years, Congress has raised the savings limits to encourage people to save more for retirement. Examine all investment options available in a personal retirement plan when planning for your financial future. 534 Personal Finance ]]></text>

You got great grades. You&apos;re one step closer to the college of your choice and maybe even lower car insurance costs&ndash;all for being responsible. Believe it or not, your credit history will have a similar impact. As a first-time borrower, you may find it tough to get a credit card or a car loan on your own. Without a credit history to check, lenders often will require a co-signer to guarantee that the loan will be repaid if you fail to repay. This person could be your parent or another relative with a good credit history. The rest is up to you. How can you prove to future lenders that you are a good credit risk? The most important step is simple: Pay your bills on time to eliminate credit card debt and strengthen your credit report. Every late or missed payment will end up on your credit report. Are You a Good Credit Risk? Capacity Your expenses, your job, and how long you have had it Character Financial history and payment record Capital What assets you have to back up a loan, like a savings account, property, investments << Whether or not you are judged to be a good credit risk depends on the three C&apos;s. Your Credit Report Your credit report is your financial report card. In addition to your payment history, it includes the details of your bank and credit card accounts. Lenders can see how much debt you are already carrying. They can also see if you have had any bankruptcies or judgments against you or if you owe back taxes. National credit reporting agencies create a FICO score based on your credit history. The score falls in a range from about 300 to 900. Usually, a score of at least 700 gives you access to reasonable credit. For a fee, you can find out your credit score at MyFico.com. A bad credit report can sink more than a loan. It also affects your chances of getting insurance, an apartment, a mortgage&ndash;even a job. Like lenders, many landlords and employers check credit histories. They see on-time bill paying as an indication of whether you will be a responsible tenant or worker. The Fair Credit Reporting Act sets the terms by which credit information about you can be gathered and used. Protecting Your Credit Suppose there are mistakes in your credit report or you have made poor credit choices. What can you do? Free credit reports are available once per year from each of the three national credit- reporting agencies: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Sample credit reports can be found on their Web sites.

Here are some steps to take if you have trouble paying your bills on time. &bull; Reassess your needs and wants.

Credit comes in many forms, from car loans to mortgages&ndash; and most popular of all, the credit card. Credit Convenience Credit cards make buying easy.

Teens and Credit Americans under 21 can have a credit card if a parent or other individual over 21 co-signs the account or if they can prove that they have the income to make the monthly payments. About one third of all high school students use cards linked to the account of a parent or relative. Credit card companies eager to issue young people their first card used to give out freebies such as t-shirts, but reforms in 2009 made this illegal. Why do they want your business? The answer is simple: teens spend. Each year, consumers between the ages of 12 and 19 spend well over $100 billion of their own and their parents&apos; money. Credit card companies want to tap into this spending power. Credit Traps and Tips So there you are, card in hand and a world of things to buy. Unless you learn how to use credit responsibly, you could find yourself in a deep hole. You won&apos;t be there alone. It is estimated a majority of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 spend nearly 30 percent of their monthly income on debt repayment. Ideally, you&apos;ll want to pay off your credit card balance in full every month. True, you are required to make only a small minimum payment. But for every dollar you don&apos;t pay this month, you&apos;ll pay interest next month. Worse, first-time cardholders without an established credit rating are often subject to a higher-than-normal annual percentage rate (APR). What if you pay late or miss a payment entirely? You&apos;ll be subject to a late penalty. The finance charges, which include the APR and any related fees, can quickly add up to more than your initial purchase. Suppose a credit card company requires a $10 minimum payment on a $290 outfit. If your payment is late by even one day, you&apos;ll get hit with a late fee and more than likely a significantly higher APR. And if your balance goes over the credit limit set by the issuer, there&apos;s a charge for that, too. Suddenly, the $290 “bargain” can turn into a $600 headache. Repayment Schedule on a $2,000 Credit Card Loan at 19 Percent Interest 100643525$1,994$1,193$619$424NUMBER OF MONTHS TO PAY $40$50$75$100MINIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT TOTAL INTEREST PAYMENT SOURCE: Government Accounting Office: “College Students and Credit Cards” >> This table shows the cumulative effect of a 19 percent interest rate on a $2,000 credit card debt. A person paying only $40 a month would incur $1,994 in interest charges by the time the loan was repaid&ndash;paying nearly double the amount of the original debt. The Cost of Cash Fees mount up even faster if you use your credit card to get cash. A cash advance carries an up-front fee of 2 percent to 4 percent, plus a higher interest rate than the regular card. And the charges start the second the ATM coughs out the cash.

    <page pageNumber="604"> <text><![CDATA[ Read the Fine Print The importance of reading the fine print of a credit card&apos;s terms of agreement should not be lost on any cardholder. The Truth in Lending Act requires banks to provide complete information on the APR, fees, and surcharges. New regulations require credit card companies to tell you how long it will take to pay off your balance if you make only minimum payments. Companies must also notify customers before interest rates increase or terms change. You can opt out of the changes, which will close the account. You can then pay off the balance under the old terms. The time it takes to review these terms could save you headaches and money. Credit or Debit? The surest way to avoid the debt trap is to keep credit card use to a minimum. For lower-cost purchases, you are better off using a debit card, a check, or cash. A debit card offers the same convenience as a credit card. But because the money comes straight out of your bank account, there is no interest rate and no risk of going over your limit. The danger of debit cards is that they are so easy to use, you may lose track of your spending. For online purchases, however, it&apos;s wisest to use a credit card. It offers greater security. Getting Into Debt With today&apos;s world of easy credit, it is not hard to find yourself in debt over your head. Using credit cards or borrowing money is not necessarily bad. You get into trouble when you go overboard. Types of Loans Loans come in several forms. Single-payment loans are short-term loans paid off in one lump sum. Installment loans, such as home mortgages or auto loans, are repaid at regularly scheduled intervals. Each payment is divided between principal, or the amount borrowed, and interest. (The earlier you are in the life of the loan, the higher the proportion of each payment goes toward interest.) A third kind of debt is revolving credit, where the amount borrowed and paid changes each month. The best example is a credit card. There are two general types of loans&ndash;secured and unsecured. A secured loan is one where the borrower puts up some type of collateral, usually a piece of property that can be sold by the lender if the borrower fails to pay back the loan, in order to qualify for the loan. An unsecured loan is one without any collateral. Lenders view secured loans as less risky because they have something they can use to recoup their losses if the borrower fails to repay them. As a result, secured loans tend to have lower interest rates than unsecured loans. Similar to secured loans, lenders also view loans where the borrower has put down a down payment&ndash;a cash payment to the seller of a good that the loan is for&ndash;as less risky and will offer lower interest rates for loans with a down payment. How Much is Too Much? Carrying some debt is not a problem&ndash;almost everybody does it. But you need to stay within safe limits and you need to keep in mind your obligation to repay borrowed money. A general rule is that your debt payments, including 538 Personal Finance ]]></text>

You can estimate your own debt-to-income ratio by dividing the amount of money that you owe by the amount of money that you earn. If the result is higher than 36 percent, you probably owe too much money. Here are some warning signs: &bull; Inability to make minimum payments &bull; Relying on credit cards out of necessity and not convenience &bull; Borrowing from one credit card in order to pay another &bull; Tapping retirement savings or other investments to pay loans Getting Out One reason people take on too much debt is that they want stuff NOW and ignore the fact that credit is a promise to pay later. They don&apos;t adequately plan for the fact that the repayment of principal and interest begins to eat into money needed for necessities. Caught in the Debt Spiral Take Andy. His entry-level job had an entry-level salary. The debt he ran up in college soared as he depended more and more on “plastic” to cover the basics. Paying just the minimum spared his credit temporarily, but he was racking up high finance charges. Once he started missing payments, creditors began calling. Now what? Credit Counseling Andy hated to admit it, but he needed help. He tried credit counseling. A credit counseling agency will negotiate on your behalf with the creditors, trying to get you an extension of time and lower interest rates. For a small service fee, it will take over your monthly payments. Andy checked with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies to find a reputable agency. He now writes one check per month to the agency, instead of three to his creditors. Other Options If you find yourself in Andy&apos;s shoes, there are other options to consider&ndash; with caution. You could swallow your pride and ask a relative or friend for a loan. If you go this route, though, make sure that you have a written repayment plan and offer to pay interest. You could also try taking out a loan from a credit union. Credit unions usually offer more lenient credit terms than banks. You may, however, need a co-signer. Bankruptcy: The Last Resort Bankruptcy is truly your last option. Common reasons for bankruptcy are large hospital and medical bills, uninsured losses, or high credit card bills. Some of these are unavoidable, but many people get into serious debt because of poor decisions and lack of foresight. Once you declare bankruptcy it will be harder for you to obtain credit. Nearly every credit application asks: Have you ever declared bankruptcy? So take this step only with the help of a lawyer who specializes in bankruptcy and can explain the options and consequences. One option is known as Chapter 7, or liquidation. You give up your assets in exchange for your debts. The cash value of your assets is paid to the creditors. To reduce fraud and make it harder to declare bankruptcy, the federal government passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Debtors must prove that their income is below their state&apos;s median income and complete financial counseling and financial management education. Also, the government randomly audits debtors to check up on the accuracy of the bankruptcy documents. Personal Finance 539 ]]></text>

The amount to be repaid depends on how much you have versus how much you owe. Any form of bankruptcy will make it far more difficult to rebuild a secure financial future.

You got distracted while you were changing a CD. Your parents are using the word grounded a lot&ndash;and also the word insurance. Sure, they have you covered on their policy, but a moving violation could raise their rates&ndash;and yours&ndash;through the roof. What Is Insurance? The road of life is peppered with the unexpected. Chances are you&apos;ll hit a few bumps along the way. Insurance is part of a risk management plan that will protect you against financial losses. Basically, insurance is a bet between you and your insurer. You are betting that something bad will happen to you, such as illness or a car accident. The company is betting against it. Neither your judgment, nor the insurer&apos;s, is perfectly accurate. Some people tend to underestimate their chances of something bad happening because of a “it can&apos;t happen to me” mindset. Other people tend to overestimate the chances of bad things happening if they have heard of or seen similar things happen to other people recently. Having insurance can also have an unexpected effect on some people&apos;s behavior. Having the security and peace of mind of having insurance can cause some people to engage in riskier behavior than they might if they did not have insurance. Insurers are aware of this and have measures in place to encourage their policyholders to reduce the frequency or size of their claims, measures like deductibles and copayments. Types of Insurance There are four basic types of insurance coverage most adults should have. Your age, family situation, and income are some major factors to consider when deciding the type and amount of coverage you should get. &bull; Auto: Protects you and other drivers in case of an accident that results in damage and injury. It also protects you in case of theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. Most states require you to have your own auto insurance or to be listed as a driver on someone else&apos;s policy. &bull; Health: Protects you in case of illness or injury. It also covers the cost of routine medical and preventive care, prescriptions, and in some cases dental care. Even if you&apos;re healthy, having health insurance is a very good idea. &bull; Property: Protects your home or apartment in case of damage or loss of belongings due to water, fire, or wind. It can cover your liability if someone is injured in your home and sues you for damages. Most policies do not, however, protect against flood damage. You must buy that coverage separately. 540 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="607"> <text><![CDATA[ &bull; Life: Pays a set amount to your beneficiary in case of your death. The beneficiary is the person or entity, such as a charity, that you name as the recipient of the death benefit of your life insurance policy. The two most common types of life insurance are term, or temporary, insurance and whole life insurance. Rates for term insurance increase over time. The only way to collect from a term policy is to die during the term. Whole life insurance remains in effect for one&apos;s entire lifetime at a set rate. It builds cash value. The insured can borrow against the policy. What It Costs The payment you make to an insurance company is called a premium. The cost of insurance is high and getting higher. So does it pay to buy it? Absolutely. You may never have an accident and file a claim. But if you do, the amount you collect could be many times what you paid in premiums. Even a brief stay in a hospital, for example, can run up a bill of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Besides, in many cases, insurance is not optional. You can&apos;t even register a car without proof of auto insurance. Nor can you get a mortgage without homeowner coverage. Deductibles Insurance companies spread out their risk by collecting premiums from a lot of customers. They also reduce their costs by requiring co-pays and deductibles. A deductible is an amount you have to pay before your coverage kicks in. For example, if your car insurance policy has a $1,000 deductible, and you have an accident, you&apos;ll have to pay the first $1,000 in damages. The company pays the rest. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium. Co-pays If you have a co-pay, you are responsible for a small portion of the total cost of a service covered by your insurance policy. Every time you go to a doctor, you might have to pay a relatively small amount of the bill and your insurance company pays the rest. Generally, you can keep co-pays to a minimum if your medical provider&ndash;a doctor, hospital, or specialist&ndash;is part of your insurance company&apos;s healthcare network. Changing Needs As you get older, acquire more possessions, and expand your family, you have more to replace and more to protect. Coreen at 18–25 Coreen is three months into her first full-time job. Finally eligible for employee health benefits, she lets her parents know that they can remove her from their policy. She also finds an apartment and gets rental insurance to protect her possessions from damage or theft. With no dependents, Coreen leads a relatively carefree existence. She can probably get by with basic auto, rental and health coverage&ndash;for now. Karen and Bill at 25–54 Coreen&apos;s sister Karen and her husband Bill have purchased their first home. They are also expecting their second child. With a new home, children, and two cars, their insurance needs are due for a tune-up. Karen and Bill now need a medical policy that covers more checkups for the children. They also can&apos;t risk having to pay for a new car if they have an accident. With lives and assets to protect, this young family will focus on adding collision insurance to their auto policy and purchasing home, mortgage, and life insurance coverage. Alex and Isabel, Over 54 Coreen&apos;s parents, Isabel and Alex, decide to revisit their insurance needs as well. Free of dependents, they are less concerned about term or whole life insurance coverage. They are far more concerned about the cost of long-term healthcare. Personal Finance 541 ]]></text>

Because Alex and Isabel are in their 50s, they can expect to pay more for their coverage, perhaps as much as hundreds of dollars a month. Their problem will be trying to find the right coverage at an affordable price. To find the best rates, they will want to get group coverage through an employer or a large organization. Insurance Is an Investment You wind up in the hospital for an emergency appendectomy. Your house is robbed. An uninsured driver hits you from behind. You get to pick up the pieces&ndash;and, unless you&apos;re insured, the bill. It&apos;s All About Risk Insurance is all about avoiding risk. For you, that means paying now to avoid a gigantic cost later. For the insurance company, it means identifying people who are likely to cost them a bundle. Insurers set rates based on risk factors, hard statistics that predict whether someone is likely to be a bad risk. Do you plan to become a pilot or take up mountain climbing? That will make you a higher risk than a lawyer who spends leisure time doing crossword puzzles. A smoker must pay higher health insurance premiums than a nonsmoker. In the worst case, a risky lifestyle may make you uninsurable. You may also be required to purchase different types of insurance by some contracts or by governments. To qualify for a home mortgage, the lender will require you to take out a homeowner&apos;s insurance policy to protect that property in case of a loss to the property. If you live in an area prone to flooding, the government may require you to take out flood insurance before you can buy the home to protect you against property loss in the event of a flood and to protect public agencies from having to support very large numbers of people who might be victims of a flood. Similarly, many states require people to have an auto insurance policy before they can register their vehicle to be driven on public roads. Who&apos;s Got You Covered? Right now, insurance costs are probably not your concern. Most teens are covered for pretty much everything&ndash;life, health, property&ndash;by a parent or guardian. However, some teens must foot their own auto insurance bill. And that&apos;s expensive. Statistically, new drivers are high-risk. But if you want wheels, you have no choice. Health Insurance No matter how healthy your lifestyle is, you are going to face illness or accident. A bout of pneumonia or a broken leg may cost hundreds, even thousands. Even with health insurance, you&apos;ll have to pay something. But it&apos;s better than paying it all. Employer Plans Most young people are covered under parents&apos; health insurance whether they are in school or not&ndash;up to age 26. Once you enter the working world, it&apos;s up to you. If you work for a company that offers health insurance, you can usually choose from a variety of group plans. Some cover you from day one. More often, there is a waiting period. Your share of the premium is deducted from your paycheck each pay period. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium. The least expensive health insurance plan is generally a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). An HMO allows you to pick a primary care physician, to whom you pay a 542 Personal Finance ]]></text>

This is a doctor who has agreed to accept the payment level paid by the insurance company. Get Insured Can&apos;t get insurance through your job or your parents? As of 2014, you can purchase private health insurance from an exchange in your state. The healthcare reform law passed in 2010 also prevents insurance companies from denying you coverage for pre-existing conditions. << Insurance plans help people get the medical care they need, whether it&apos;s a basic check up or special treatment related to an illness or accident. Cut Your Costs The rising number of claims, plus increasing cases of fraud, have caused insurance premiums to skyrocket. But there are a number of steps you can take to get the best coverage for your buck. Comparison shop. Compare the rates of different companies. Check with the local Better Business Bureau. And don&apos;t forget word of mouth. For example, if you&apos;re shopping for auto insurance, talk to people with similar driving records. Don&apos;t just ask about premium costs. Ask about customer service as well. Low price is no bargain if an insurer takes forever to service your claim. Make yourself a better risk. If you smoke&ndash;or collect speeding tickets like they were trading cards&ndash;it&apos;s going to cost you. But insurers also reward behavior that lowers risk. A healthy lifestyle and a good driving record can keep costs in check. And while good grades won&apos;t reduce health or life insurance premiums, they might get you a discount on car insurance. Cover yourself. You and your insurer may not always see eye to eye on a claim. It&apos;s up to you to provide evidence of loss. Take pictures of that busted headlamp. And keep receipts. That way, you&apos;ll be more likely to be covered for everything you&apos;ve paid. Personal Finance 543 ]]></text>

Review your coverage before filing a claim. You&apos;ll avoid nasty surprises that way. Should I Use an Agent? Nowadays, you can often buy insurance online. Still, it might pay for you to use a licensed agent. It all depends on your needs. There are two kinds of insurance agents: captive and independent. Captive agents represent a single insurance company. Independent agents offer policies from many different companies. Both types of agents must be licensed by the state in which they sell. For most purposes, buying directly with a company or its agents works out just fine. But if you are difficult to insure&ndash;for example, if you have a bad driving record&ndash;an independent agent might be the way to go. With access to many different companies, the independent agent can help you find a company that can meet your special needs. A good agent also helps you through the process of filing a claim and acts on your behalf in dealing with the provider. Many agents are also certified to help you with other kinds of financial planning.

There&apos;s that new pair of shoes and the latest video game that you just have to have. Or do you? Before you pull out that credit card, think before you buy. Analyze the costs and benefits of the purchase. The benefits seem obvious. You have something you didn&apos;t have before that you like. The purchase may also be something you absolutely need. But, are the costs worth it? Do you have the cash to pay for it? If you make the purchase, will it keep you from purchasing something that you really need? How will you use what you are purchasing? Will something else already fill that desire or need? What will the purchase do to your future buying power? Can the purchase wait? Another thing to consider is what happens to the purchase after it has exhausted its usefulness? How will you dispose of what you have? Many items, such as electronics, no longer can just be tossed away. Laws protecting the environment govern the disposal of many products. For example, perhaps you purchase the newest cellphone on the market. What happens to the phone when you want to replace it? Will it cost you again to dispose of it? How long do you have to keep it before you dispose of it? Analyzing the costs and benefits of the disposal of personal property, including your responsibility for proper disposal, is always part of a purchase decision. A Major Purchase A major purchase is one that will use up a large chunk of your available cash or credit limit. Buying a home is an example of a major purchase. For most individuals, buying a home means many years of budgeting for repayment of a home loan. Before buying a home, people analyze the costs and benefits of home ownership. 544 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="611"> <text><![CDATA[ << Purchasing a new car involves finding the right car for the amount of money you can spend. When looking to improve or expand, business owners may make major purchases, such as a building or piece of new equipment. Business owners must analyze the costs and benefits of the purchase and how best it will be used. Likewise, businesses must determine how they might dispose of what was purchased after it no longer is needed. Will the purchase truly benefit the business and help it grow or create greater costs that will hurt business growth? Like most young people, your first major purchase may be a car. Having your own car gives you the freedom to make decisions on where and when you&apos;d like to travel. It also provides a sense of pride in ownership. But, you need to do your homework and spend some time and effort to get a good deal. The Costs of Ownership Step one is to determine what kind of car you can afford to buy and adequately insure and maintain. There are many money issues to consider: &bull; how much you can put down &bull; how much you need to borrow &bull; what your monthly payment will be &bull; how much your insurance premiums will be &bull; how much car maintenance will cost &bull; what gasoline, parking, and tolls will do to your budget Since you have no credit history, you may have to search around for a bank or credit union that will lend you money. To get a vehicle loan, a bank may require you to have a co-signer, a person who is responsible for paying the loan if you default. New or Used If you are going to buy a new car, you want to determine the invoice price of the model you want, and then get at least five competitive bids from dealers. Request bids in writing and then try to negotiate. Will the dealer closest to you match the price of the dealer who is less conveniently located? You can use Web sites such as cars.com, yahoo!autos, and myride.com as online resources for researching and getting bids. Perhaps you have a car you would like to sell before getting another one. This will give you some additional money to use for your new purchase. It also means additional responsibilities to dispose of your personal property.

But, what if the car you want to sell has some significant mechanical problems? For example, perhaps the engine of the car cannot be repaired. Rather than sell the entire car, you decide instead to sell parts of the car. All good. What about the parts of the car you can&apos;t sell, such as a used battery? How will you properly dispose of the battery? What do the laws say about where and how you can responsibly dispose of other parts of the car that cannot be sold? How will the cost of disposal impact the amount of money you have to purchase another car? If you&apos;re buying used, get a history of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and have a mechanic inspect the car. That way you can determine how well the car has been cared for. There are also online sites that deal with buying used cars. They offer reviews of online used car classifieds, how to buy a used car from dealers or private sellers, how to negotiate with tough sellers, scams to avoid, and a list of questions for you to print out to ask the seller. New automobiles depreciate, or lose value, quickly. A new car loses half its value in the first three years. But buying a new car can make sense if you plan to keep the car for a long time. You have to carry collision insurance if you have a car loan. Used cars are less expensive to buy and insure, but maintenance costs will likely be higher. Budget accordingly. Two things will have a major affect on what car you choose: what you like and what you can afford based on your savings and income. If you are still in school, you will have fewer options than a well-paid professional has. To get a taste of what it is like to plan for a major purchase, choose two differently priced cars from ads in the newspaper or online. Go to a website with a loan calculator, like Bankrate.com, and estimate how much you would have to pay per month with various down payments, interest rates, and loan payment plans. How much income would you need in order to buy the car of your choice? Making A Decision &bull; Taxes and fees will be lower on a less expensive car. &bull; You can lower your monthly payment by putting more money down. &bull; A lower interest rate will mean you pay less over the life of the loan. Points to Remember >> Put some time and thought into making a decision that best meets your needs based on your available resources. Leasing Leasing is primarily used by businesses or by those who don&apos;t plan on driving many miles. If you go over the mileage allowed for the term of the auto lease, generally 12,000 miles per year, you have to pay a substantial fee for each additional mile. If you have a long drive to college or a job, the commute could eat up the mileage limit in no time. Dealing With Dealers You might want to consider taking a more experienced person along with you when you buy your first car. It pays to have an ally. People in business have experience with purchasing, using, and disposing of business property. Their advice may prove to be very helpful to you in making your purchase. 546 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="613"> <text><![CDATA[ In many cases, salespeople hold the upper hand when it comes to negotiating car prices. You can take a few steps, however, to level the buying field and avoid being pressured into spending more money than you want or can afford. &bull; Be prepared. Know what you want, and get bids based on the invoice price. &bull; Don&apos;t be talked into unnecessary options. &bull; Don&apos;t ever discuss trade-in until after you&apos;ve settled on a sale price. A dealer might want to consider the trade-in vehicle as a reduction to the sticker price. In fact, any trade-in should have nothing to do with the price of the new car. &bull; Don&apos;t be pushed into a quick decision, no matter what one-day specials are dangled before you. &bull; Get the sale offers in writing. If a dealer is not willing to put all agreements in writing, walk away. Warranties Dealers are required by federal law to post a Buyer&apos;s Guide on the used cars they offer for sale. This guide must specify whether the vehicle is being sold “as is” or with a warranty, and what percentage of the repair costs the dealer will pay. Most new and some used cars come with a manufacturer&apos;s warranty that covers certain repairs for a set period of time or up to a certain mileage limit. Extended warranties increase the amount of time or mileage that repairs will be covered. No warranty covers basic maintenance, like oil changes or new tires. If you do happen to buy a car and the next day the engine falls out, you&apos;re protected by federal and state “lemon laws.” First, however, you should go back to the dealer if you think you&apos;ve bought a lemon. If you cannot reach an agreement, check the law to see what recourse you have. Can I Afford It? You&apos;ve dreamed of this day of living under your roof and by your own rules. Independence. Rent. Bills. Cooking and cleaning. Yes, life is full of both ups and downs. The first reality check is figuring out what you can afford. A general rule of thumb is that your rent and utility payments should not cost more than one week&apos;s take-home pay. How can you figure the average monthly cost of utilities? Ask the landlord or the previous tenant. You will have to plan ahead. Many landlords require that you pay the first and last month&apos;s rent up front. In addition, you may have to pay a security deposit. This money is set aside for repairs of any damage you may do to the apartment beyond normal wear and tear. Finding the Right Place Finding the right apartment or rental home takes more than a little time, effort, and money. It also takes evaluating the costs and benefits of any rental option. The federal government has stepped in to level the playing field. The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 makes it illegal for a landlord to discriminate against a potential tenant because of that person&apos;s race, sex, national origin, or religion.

You want someone who has a compatible lifestyle and who can pay their share of the bills on time. Your search for the right roommate is just as important as your search for the right place to live. Furnishings If you have decided to rent an unfurnished apartment, you will need to be resourceful to avoid major expenses. After you have tapped family and friends, yard sales and thrift shops are potential gold mines. An unfurnished apartment is not only empty, it will probably also be bare, right down to the windows and shower&ndash;not to mention the cupboards. Protect Yourself Learn from others&apos; mistakes. Many apartment complex Web sites are chock-full of comments posted by current or previous tenants. You might even ask a passerby in the parking lot. To protect yourself from being charged for pre-existing conditions, assess and photograph any existing damage before you sign a lease.

Home Ownership Some individuals may wish to transition from renting to home ownership. Assess the financial aspects of home ownership before considering the transition. Evaluate the costs and benefits of buying a home. Owning a home usually means having a lot more space and privacy. Home ownership is an investment. You may make a substantial amount of money when you sell your home. Home ownership also means monthly mortgage payments, property insurance, and money spent for upkeep and repair. It can limit your ability to move whenever you&apos;d like, since it can take a while to sell a house. Unexpected loss of income can create difficulties in making monthly mortgage payments with the risk of foreclosure. There is a lot to know before making the transition from renting to home ownership.

Do you have the time and financial resources to take care of needed upkeep and repair, such as a new roof or furnace? Will the costs of owning a home outweigh the benefits? Assess all of the financial aspects of making the transition from renting to home ownership. Talk to a professional in real estate and banking. There are different types of home loans available to consumers. Some individuals choose a fixed-rate mortgage. In this type of loan the interest rate stays the same over the life of the mortgage, which could be up to 30 years. Some home buyers opt for a variable rate. In this case the interest rate may change over the life of the loan. A rise in interest rate means a rise in the monthly loan payment. A balloon mortgage usually comes with an initial low interest rate, but the loan balance is due within a short time, perhaps at the end of five years. Some loans only require payment of interest. In this case money is not paid toward the principle. Other loans, such as VA (Veterans Administration) loans, FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loans, or reverse mortgages, are special types of home ownership options available to individuals who qualify. It is good to analyze all options before securing a home or other consumer loan. A Growing Crime An estimated 9 million Americans have their identities stolen every year. Chances are you know someone who has been victimized. You may be a victim yourself&ndash;without even knowing it. It Can Happen Anywhere Question: What do going to the beach . . . taking out the garbage . . . and answering your e-mail have in common? Answer: They can all leave you vulnerable to identity theft. A thief can raid your wallet while you&apos;re splashing in the water. A dumpster diver can retrieve old bank statements. Or an innocent-looking e-mail could be a phishing scam to get your personal info. Most people don&apos;t realize they&apos;ve been victimized until it&apos;s too late. You might not find out until you&apos;re denied a student loan because you&apos;ve missed several car payments&ndash;and you don&apos;t even own a car. 550 Personal Finance ]]></text>

Nearly 30 percent fell into the under-30 age bracket. One reason for this trend could be that younger people tend to spend more time on the Internet, where much identity theft occurs. The Cost of Theft Once they have your ID, thieves can use it to commit a wide variety of fraud, such as obtaining credit cards or even a mortgage in your name. Worse, if the crook who stole your identity gets arrested for any crime, you could get stuck with the criminal record. In too many cases, the burden of proof is on the victim. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, it can take 600 hours to repair the damage. Some victims need up to 10 years to fully clear their records. If your identity is stolen, you could face higher insurance costs, credit card fees, and interest rates for loans&ndash;or may even have trouble finding a job. Prime Target: You So should you be worried? Identity theft topped the list of all complaints filed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2012, with more than 369,000 complaints. About one in every 40 households experienced identity theft of a minor. About 27 percent of child ID theft cases are caused by individuals known to the minor. Child ID theft is difficult to resolve. It is important to always keep information about a child&apos;s identity in a safe place. This includes a child&apos;s Social Security number. Why Me? Why are young people so vulnerable? One reason is that most teens have not established credit records that can be monitored. In addition, studies show that teens&ndash; &bull; are less likely than adults to check their credit card records. &bull; are more likely than adults to frequent the Internet and provide personal information. &bull; take greater risks relative to older age groups. &bull; often have an “it can&apos;t happen to me” attitude. Finally, many Americans do not use their Social Security number until around the age of 15, when they apply for driver permits or first jobs. As a result, identity thefts against them may go unnoticed for years. There have even been babies that were the victims of identity theft! At College Over half of all personal information security breaches take place at universities, experts say. Part of the reason may be that nearly half of all college students have had their grades posted by using a Social Security number. It&apos;s within your rights to tell a college administrator not to post your personal information. Lower Your Risk Although there is no foolproof way to safeguard your identity, there are a number of common-sense steps you can take to protect yourself against fraud. Be alert online. Think twice before sharing personal information. Users on social networking sites like Facebook often post personal statuses, favorite music, addresses, cellphone numbers, and former employers. All of this information could be used to create a credit account or take out a loan in your name. Personal Finance 551 ]]></text>

You don&apos;t have to drive anywhere, stand in line, or haul the stuff home. A few clicks will do it all. And you can shop 24/7. If you have ever gone from store to store looking for a hard-to-find item, you will appreciate the ease of shopping online. Who has the item in stock? Who has the lowest price? Free shipping?

Online Shopping Tips Use a credit card as it offers the best safeguard against fraud, but never e-mail a credit card number, bank account information, password, or PIN number. Check out the reviews written by other buyers. Look for a padlock icon in the browser and “https” for security. Check for endorsements from rating agencies, such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Steer clear of sellers who offer low prices only to squeeze you on shipping costs. 1 2 3 4 5 << These five online shopping tips provide advice on making sure the sites you use are secure and reputable.

Hate it, and you can warn others as well. E-Buyer Be Aware Along with its unique benefits, online shopping includes some unique challenges. How do you really know if the online retailer you&apos;re dealing with is reputable and your information will be secure? For the most part, you have a higher degree of confidence if there is a brick-and-mortar backup to the online stores. Major retailers devote a lot of resources to ensuring that their customers have a satisfying and secure online shopping experience. That does not mean that you should not deal with online-only vendors. You just need to be sure the sites you use are secure and reputable. Bidding Online Comfortable online? The biggest and best deals often exist beyond the big stores. Two of the most-widely used alternatives are the relatively free classifieds and auction sites, such as eBay. These offer shopping alternatives that come with a different set of rules tailored for the online marketplace. Local appeal can be a major advantage. Online classifieds provide access to backyard buyers and sellers at relatively no cost. Your next entertainment center might very well be three towns or three blocks away. In its attempt to keep you scam- and worry-free, these services encourage buyers to deal locally with folks you can meet in person. The site also includes detailed safety guidelines. On Internet auctions, buyers can quickly and easily comparison shop for just about anything, from used cars and leather bomber jackets to concert tickets and even private jets. In this auction format, shoppers can engage in competitive bidding wars. So how are buyers and sellers protected? Buyers rate the reliability and service provided by sellers and eBay makes these ratings available to you. However, if you win a bid and do not go through with the purchase, you are stuck with a negative rating for the rest of your eBay life. There are also services that make it possible for you to pay an individual seller using your credit card. Fighting Fraud There is a new charge on your credit card bill! But where is the merchandise? You never got it, or even worse, you never ordered it. Many credit card companies will investigate suspected cases of fraud on your behalf, limiting your liability to $50. Also, the Fair Credit Billing Act allows you to withhold payment if you believe that someone has stolen your card number. You also have the option of filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at www.ftc.gov. The FTC offers you advice on how to protect against fraud, identity theft, and questionable business practices. The site guides you step-by-step through the process of filing a consumer complaint.

    <page pageNumber="620"> <text><![CDATA[ 554 Personal Finance average cost of tuition and fees at two-year public colleges increased by 3 percent each year from 2003 to 2013. During the same time period, tuition and fees at four-year institutions increased 4.2 percent each year. The good news is that increases posted for the 2013–2014 tuition year were below the average rate increase for the preceding decade. Choose Carefully If rapidly rising costs continue, in 2020 a four-year public education will cost over $158,510 (in constant dollars) for incoming freshman. This includes tuition, fees, room and board, supplies, transportation, and other personal expenses. By 2025 the projected cost is $212,123. The cost at a private university will be approximately twice that amount. For most students, those are pretty scary numbers.

Financial Aid Basics The thought of paying for college might send you into panic mode. But there is help. It comes in three forms: (a) grants and scholarships; (b) work- study programs; and (c) loans. The idea is to reduce the amount you&apos;re going to owe by applying for as many sources of aid as possible. If you&apos;re like most students, you will qualify for some type of assistance. The biggest fi- nancial aid error is not to apply at all. Many colleges are substituting loans for grants and some are experimenting by waiving tuition for certain income levels altogether.

For example, you may need to have your parents co-sign for a student loan. Federal Government When it comes to government aid, the Department of Education offers three basic loans: Direct Loans, Stafford Loans for parents or students, and the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). For those in financial need, there is the Federal Perkins Loan. These loans have a fixed interest rate and are made available through the college. Students who go on to take teaching jobs in certain areas or who volunteer in the Americorps, Peace Corps, or VISTA programs may be eligible to have their federal loans partially repaid or even canceled. To help qualifying graduates, the government limits loan payments to 10% of their discretionary income. Any person who makes their payment on time will have the balance forgiven after 20 years. Private Sources If money from government loans does not cover all your college expenses, private lending sources could fill the gap. Compared to government loans, regular commercial loans typically have higher interest rates, fees, and credit requirements. Trade organizations and educational institutions also offer lending aid. Check with your guidance counselor to find out more information. Other Sources There are other ways to obtain financial aid without taking out loans. All kinds of students can qualify for financial aid that does not have to be repaid. You need not be valedictorian or an all-state basketball star. Other sources of financial aid include grants, scholarships, and work study. Grants A no-strings-attached grant is a no-brainer to consider when applying for financial aid. Available from the federal government, state governments, and higher education institutions, grants are usually awarded according to financial need and tuition rates. Analyze and compare each grant option to see which one is best for you. There are wide varieties of grants out there. Evaluate grant opportunities before applying for a grant. Some grants may be specific to a particular area of study. Others may be specific to an affiliation with a business, or you may need a history of community work in order to qualify. Don&apos;t forget FAFSA, also known as the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, available at www.fafsa.ed.gov. All students should complete the FAFSA, even if they believe they will not qualify for aid. There is always a chance that family circumstances will change. You need to complete this form if you want to be considered for federal aid, such as the Pell Grant and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant. These grants are given to students with “exceptional financial need.” You will need some basic information in order to complete the FAFSA. This includes your date of birth, income information for yourself and possibly for your parent(s), and basic information on available assets that could be used to pay for college. It&apos;s good to work with someone who is familiar with the FAFSA before completing the application, in order to learn more about the process. Find out more by checking out the U.S. Department of Education Web sites www.federalstudentaid.ed.gov or www.students.gov, your state education agency, or your high school guidance office.

    <page pageNumber="622"> <text><![CDATA[ 556 Personal Finance Scholarships and Work Study Schools offer various scholarship opportunities. Be- sides aid from the school itself, there are scholarships available from individuals, local community initiatives, and civic groups. Check with local organizations such as the Kiwanis and Lions Clubs. Some companies also offer scholarships to children of their em- ployees. Likewise, you might evaluate scholarship opportunities offered by state govern- ments. Take time to research and evaluate scholarships offered by professional organiza- tions, state governments, individuals, and from the schools you would like to attend. Work-study programs are a win-win situation for the student, college, and community. This type of aid allows students to earn money to offset their educational expenses. Con- tact the schools you are interested in attending. Ask about the types of work-study op- portunities offered by the school. Researching and evaluating work-study and scholarship opportunities will help in determining constructive ways to fund your college education. In addition, investigate nontraditional methods of paying for college or post-secondary education and training, such as becoming a resident assistant who offers tutoring services to younger students. Some individuals set up a special investment fund called Plan 529 for children while they are in their early years. The money can later be used for education. Time spent in comparing and contrasting other sources of funding may lead you to some excellent possibilities to help pay for your college education. Getting a Job You may already have had your first job&ndash;after school, weekends, or summers. But for most of us, finding a full-time, long-term job doesn&apos;t come until after we graduate from high school or college. Your Resumé The first step is to prepare a resumé, a written summary of your education- al and work experience. Think of it as an advertisement to market yourself to an employer. You might be thinking, “That&apos;s fine if I have a lot of experience to list. But this is my first real job.” True, but that doesn&apos;t mean you don&apos;t have qualities that employers are inter- ested in. For example, suppose you worked the same job every summer for three years running. That shows that somebody liked you enough to keep hiring you back. Your service in school clubs or volunteer organizations could indicate qualities such as leader- ship, planning abilities, and a strong work ethic. Academic honors can count for a lot, too. Be sure to organize your resumé in a neat, readable fashion&ndash;no fancy type.

    <page pageNumber="623"> <text><![CDATA[ References Some employers may ask for references. If you&apos;ve been applying to colleges, you know the drill. Pick people&ndash;other than family&ndash;who can tell potential employers about your character and work ethic: a former boss, a colleague from an internship, a professor or advisor. Be sure to check with potential choices in advance to be sure they are willing to serve as your reference. Be ready with names, home or business addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers. Know Where to Look So you&apos;re ready to look for a job. Where should you start? Make a list of places that seem most promising. And try to find out something about a company before you apply there. It&apos;s all just part of being prepared. You may want to consider a variety of factors when looking for jobs, including location, transportation to and from the job, how the job might affect your family, what level of certainty there is to the job, how much independence you would have on the job, and how satisfied you would be with the work. Looking for a job that is a good fit for you and your life can go a long way in helping you excel in the workplace. The Interview That very first job interview can be an exciting but nerve-wracking experience. But you can prepare for it. Hold a mock interview with family members or friends. Have them ask you possible questions and then critique your responses and your delivery. Make a Good Impression The minute you step into a potential employer&apos;s office, you are being judged. Don&apos;t blow it before you open your mouth. Posture, eye contact, and a firm handshake go a long way to making a positive impression. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. &ndash;Maxim attributed to 20th century Dutch author William Triesthof Believe it or not, dressing the wrong way can be a deal-breaker. What works on the beach or in a dance club won&apos;t cut it in the office. Even a company that allows “casual” dress on the job doesn&apos;t want to see you in tank tops, cutoffs, or flip-flops. Be safe. Think conservative and professional. Yes, that may mean a suit or a dress. Let them tell you that you don&apos;t have to dress that way&ndash;after you get the job. Turn Off That Cellphone The person interviewing you may have to interrupt to take a phone call. But you do not get the same privilege. Before you step in that office, make sure your cellphone is switched off. Nothing will ruin a good interview faster than a ringing cellphone. Ask the Right Questions Where do you see yourself in five years? Why did you choose your particular college major? Why are you the best candidate for this position? Expect to be peppered with questions. But be equally as prepared to ask them. Questions like these show you&apos;re interested in the job: &bull; What are the company&apos;s goals for the next year or so? &bull; How does this job fit in with the company&apos;s goals? &bull; Describe a typical day here in this department. Steer clear of questions about pay, benefits, hours, and vacation time. All of that will be covered if you are asked back for a second interview. Personal Finance 557 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="625"> <text><![CDATA[ Your pay stub shows your gross pay, the total amount of income you earned during the pay period. If you are paid hourly, it should be equal to the number of hours you worked times your hourly wage. (It will also show if you worked overtime at a higher rate.) If you are on an annual salary, it&apos;s your salary divided by the number of pay periods in the year. Withholdings You will immediately notice that your net pay&ndash;the amount the check is made out for&ndash;is far less than your gross pay. Where did the rest of the money go? Your stub lists all your payroll withholdings, the earnings that come out of your check before you get it. Some of these withholdings are voluntary. For example, if you join a company medical or insurance plan, your share of these benefits comes out of your check. Other withholdings, however, go into taxes to the state and federal government. Federal and State Deductions Most workers have federal and state taxes deducted from their earnings. Your employer is also required to pay the federal government a certain percentage of your earnings. XYZ Corporation100 Corporation Crt.

FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. It is a U.S. payroll tax on employees and employers to fund programs that provide benefits for retirees, the disabled, and children of deceased workers. Medicare provides hospital insurance benefits. The W-4 Form Federal and state taxes are deducted based on an estimate of how much you will owe in yearly taxes. Most workers are required to fill out a W-4 form when they start a new job. It includes guidelines to help you do the calculations needed to estimate how much will be withheld from each paycheck. The W-4 gives you the option of taking certain personal allowances that will lower the amount of tax withheld from your income. For example, you may take an exemption for yourself and your spouse. You also can take an exemption for anyone who is dependent on your income, such as a child. Young people who are not married and have no children will generally claim a single exemption.

Taxes and You Welcome to the workforce! You have joined the ranks of taxpayers. But why do you have to pay taxes anyhow? Governments have expenses. They have to pay salaries for thousands of employees and provide services for millions of citizens. The biggest source of government revenue is taxes. And you are required by law to pay your share. Don&apos;t Mess With the IRS Among taxes, the federal income tax is top dog. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), an agency within the Treasury Department, applies federal income tax laws passed by Congress. The agency generates tax forms and collects taxes. The IRS will notice if you don&apos;t pay what you owe and impose hefty financial penalties for any misdeeds. The federal income tax is a progressive tax, so people with the highest income have the highest tax rates. The system also includes hundreds of tax breaks for people with special financial burdens, such as people paying for college or starting a business, as well as rewards for actions like making a donation to charity. Other Taxes Most state governments collect income tax, too. In addition, states and local communities levy other kinds of taxes, such as sales tax and property tax. Sales taxes vary from state to state, but they generally involve paying a fixed percentage on most items you buy. Essentials of life&ndash;such as food and medicine&ndash;are generally exempt from sales tax. Property taxes are based on the value of privately owned homes and land. Taxes are also collected on income you didn&apos;t work for. If Aunt Bessie leaves you money in her will, you have to pay an inheritance tax. If you buy stock and you make a lot of money when you sell it, that&apos;s also taxed. State Sales Tax << Americans pay federal taxes no matter where they live. State taxes are another matter. Some states do not impose an income tax, but assess a sales tax. Alaska residents, who pay no sales or income tax, have the least per capita tax rates in the nation.

Filing is the only way to get a refund, or return of excess taxes paid. But whether you&apos;ve got a refund coming or not, it&apos;s against the law not to file an income tax return. The W-2 The most common federal tax form is the W-2, which reports wages paid to employees and taxes withheld from them. The form also reports FICA taxes to the Social Security Administration. Employers must complete and send out a W-2 to every employee by January 31. Save these documents! Your W-2&apos;s must be attached to your tax return when you file. 560 Personal Finance ]]></text>

Federal income tax forms are due to the IRS in April each year. 1040 and Beyond When you file your income tax return, which is due by April 15, you&apos;ll use Form 1040, the Individual Income Tax Return. By filling it out properly, you will learn if you owe more money to the government or if the government owes you money. To make life easier, the government introduced the Form 1040EZ, which is the simplest tax form. Its use is limited to taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000 who take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions, that is, listing them separately. Many unmarried people with no children also qualify to use this form. If you have income other than wages, salaries, and tips, Form 1099 comes into play. It&apos;s a statement you receive from payers of interest income, such as banks and savings institutions, that summarizes your interest income for the year. You may also have deductions from your income that you can claim. A common deduction is charitable donations. Many people enjoy the satisfaction they gain from helping charitable organizations and donate some of their income each year. A portion of those donations is deductible from your income on your federal taxes. Be sure to look closely as any categories of income deduction as they can reduce your tax bill considerably. Don&apos;t Guess&ndash;Get Help! You want to make sure you get all the tax deductions that the IRS allows. Each form has step-by-step instructions, but they might not answer all your questions. Here are some other places to get advice: &bull; The IRS has a user-friendly Web site, with lots of information. It can be found at www.irs.gov. &bull; Call the IRS at (800) 829-1040. You can talk to a tax specialist, or even schedule an appointment for help at IRS service centers. But don&apos;t delay. The closer you get to April 15, the harder it may be to get timely help. &bull; Tax-preparation services and tax accountants will prepare your tax return for a fee. Some will file your return for you. If you prepare your return on paper, you must send it to the IRS Service Center listed in the instruction booklet and at the IRS Web site. There are ways you can prepare and “efile” your return online. Filing in this way will get you a faster tax refund. But you usually will have to pay a fee, especially if you use a tax preparation firm. Personal Finance 561 ]]></text>

What would happen if you tried to put toppings on a pizza before you put down the dough for the crust? When studying history, you need to analyze the information by sequencing significant events, individuals, and time periods in order to understand them. Practice this skill by using the reading on this page. Two Crises for Banking As a result of the many bank failures of the Great Depression, banks were closely regulated from 1933 through the 1960s. The government restricted the interest rates banks could pay depositors and the rates that banks could charge consumers for loans. By the 1970s, bankers were eager for relief from federal regulation. The Savings and Loan Crisis In the late 1970s and 1980s, Congress passed laws to deregulate, or remove some restrictions on, several industries. Unfortunately, this deregulation contributed to a crisis in a class of banks known as Savings and Loans (S&Ls). Government regulation had protected S&Ls from some of the stresses of the marketplace. Thus, they were unprepared for the intense competition they faced after deregulation. [ 1. ] Identify the topic and the main events that relate to the topic. Quickly skim titles and headings to determine the topic of the passage. As you read the passage, write a list of significant events, individuals, or time periods related to the topic. [ 2. ] Note any dates and time words such as “before” and “after” that indicate the chronological order of events. Look through your list of events, individuals, or time periods and write down the date for each. This will give you information to apply absolute chronology by sequencing the events, individuals, or time periods. Remember that some events may have taken place over a number of months or years. Is your date the time when the event started or ended? Make sure to note enough details that you can remember the importance of the information. If no date is given, look for words such as “before” or “after” that can tell you where to place this event, time period, or individual compared to others on your list. This will allow you to apply relative chronology by sequencing the events, individuals, or time periods. [ 3. ] Determine the time range of the events. Place the events in chronological order on a timeline. Look for the earliest and latest events, individuals, or time periods on your list. The span of time between the first and last entries gives you the time range. To apply absolute chronology, sequence the entries by writing the date of the first event on the left side of a piece of paper and the date of the last event on the right side. Draw a line connecting the two events. This will be your timeline. Once you have drawn your timeline, put the events in order by date along the line. Label their dates. To apply relative chronology, sequence the significant individuals, events, or time periods on an undated timeline, in the order that they happened. You now have a clear image of the important events related to this topic. You can organize and interpret information from visuals by analyzing the information and applying absolute or relative chronology to the events. This will help you understand the topic better when you can see how events caused or led to other events. You will also be able to analyze information by developing connections between historical events over time. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="629"> <text><![CDATA[ Categorize When you analyze information by categorizing, you create a system that helps you sort items into categories, or groups with shared characteristics, so that you can understand the information. Categorizing helps you see what groups of items have in common. Practice this skill using the chart on this page. What categories are shown on this chart? Copy the chart on a sheet of paper and work with a partner to enter examples pertaining to the United States for each category. Foreign Policy Challenge Economic Challenge [ 1. ] Identify similarities and differences among items you need to understand. You need to pay careful attention and sometimes do research to find the similarities and differences among the facts, topics, or objects that you need to understand. Scientists find groups, or categories, of related animals by analyzing the details of the animals&apos; bodies. For example, insects with similar wings, legs, and mouthparts probably belong in the same category. Gather similar information about all the things you need to understand. For example, if you know the location of one thing, try to find the locations of all the things you are studying. If you have different types of information about your topics, you will not be able to group them easily. [ 2. ] Create a system to group items with common characteristics. Once you have gathered similar kinds of information on the items you need to understand, look for items that share characteristics or features. Create categories based on a feature shared by all of the facts, topics, or objects you need to understand. For example, if you have gathered information on the population and political systems of several countries, you could categorize them by the size of their population or their type of political system. 21st Century Skills 563 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="630"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 3. ] Form the groupings. Put each of the items that you are studying into one of the categories that you have created. If some items do not fit, you may need to make a new category or modify your categories. Label each category for the characteristic shared by its members. Examples of labels for categories might include “Countries with more than 100 million people,” “Countries with fewer than 1 million people,” “Democracies,” or “Dictatorships.” Analyze Cause and Effect When you analyze information by identifying cause-and-effect relationships, you find how one event leads to the next. It is important to find evidence that one event caused another. If one event happened earlier than another, it did not necessarily cause the later event. Understanding causes and effects can help you solve problems. Practice this skill as you study the cause-and-effect chart on this page. Agricultural Causes of the Depression of 1893 Westward migration occurs; farming technology improves. Farm prices fall. Farmers increase production to pay bills and prices drop further. Banks foreclose on farms. As the number of farms increases, farmers buy more land and equipment on credit. Depression hits Europe and the demand for U.S. exports decreases. [ 1. ] Choose a starting point of observation. When trying to understand a historical event, choose the time of that event. If you are trying to understand a current event, you can work backward from a starting point in the present. [ 2. ] Consider earlier events to try to find connections to your starting point, including any language that signals causes. Put the evidence together to identify true causes. When reading, look for events that come before your starting point. Analyze whether these earlier events caused later events. Identify words that signal cause, such as “reason,” “because,” and “led to.” Analyze the information by developing connections between historical events. Make sure that there is evidence showing that the earlier events caused the later events and did not just happen earlier. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="631"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 3. ] Consider later events to try to find connections to your starting point, including any language that signals effects. Put the evidence together to determine true effects. Look for events that come after your starting point. Analyze the information in order to determine whether these later events are effects of earlier events. Identify words that signal effect, such as “led to,” “so,” and “therefore.” Make sure that there is evidence showing that these later events were caused by earlier events and did not just happen later. [ 4. ] Summarize the cause-and-effect relationship and draw conclusions. Once you have identified the cause-and-effect relationships between different events, describe these relationships. Draw a diagram that develops the connections between the two historical events. Draw conclusions about any relationships that you see. Compare and Contrast When you analyze information by comparing and contrasting two or more things, you look for similarities and differences between them. This skill helps you understand the things that you are comparing and contrasting. It is also a skill that you can use in making choices. Practice this skill as you study the Venn diagram comparing socialism and communism. What words would you use to describe how these two economic ideas compare and contrast? COMPARING AND CONTRASTING SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM &bull; Requires revolutionary change &bull; Government is authoritarian, not democratic &bull; State ownership of factors of production &bull; Can include range of economic systems and practices &bull; Allows ownership of some private property &bull; Can be part of democratic system &bull; Even distribution of wealth &bull; Centralized control of economic power COMMUNISMSOCIALISM Savvas.com/FloridaSSView Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 565 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="632"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 1. ] Look for related topics and characteristics that describe them. When you are looking for similarities and differences between two things, it can help to start by identifying relationships between them. What do the two things have in common? If two things have nothing in common, such as a dog and a piece of pie, it will be difficult to find similarities or differences. On the other hand, you can compare and contrast two countries or political systems. Look through the information you have on the things or topics you want to compare and contrast, and identify the characteristics, or features, that describe those things or topics. [ 2. ] Look for words that signal comparison (“both,” “similar to,” “also”) or contrast (“unlike,” “different,” “instead”). Look for words that show comparison, or similarity, and those that show contrast, or difference. Take notes on these similarities and differences. This will make it possible to analyze information more quickly. [ 3. ] Identify similarities and differences in the topics, and draw conclusions about them. Look through your notes and analyze the ways in which your topics are similar and different. Usually, topics have both similarities and differences. Try to find patterns in these similarities and differences. For example, all the similarities between two countries might be related to climate, and all the differences might be related to economics. Draw conclusions based on these patterns. In this example, you might conclude that a country&apos;s economy does not depend on its climate. Identifying similarities and differences by comparing and contrasting two topics lets you draw conclusions that help you analyze both topics as well as other topics like them. Identify Main Ideas and Details You can analyze information in a selection by finding the main idea. A main idea is the most important point in a selection. Identifying the main idea will help you remember details, such as names, dates, and events, which should support the main idea. Practice this skill by reading the paragraph on this page. Find the main idea of this paragraph and the supporting details. During his first hundred days in office, which became known as the Hundred Days, Roosevelt proposed and Congress passed 15 major bills. These measures had three goals: relief, recovery, and reform. Roosevelt wanted to provide relief from the immediate hardships of the depression and achieve a long-term economic recovery. He also instituted reforms to prevent future depressions. [ 1. ] Scan titles, headings, and visuals before reading to see what the selection is about. Often, important ideas are included in titles, headings, and other special text. Special text may be primary sources, words that are highlighted, or ideas listed with bullet points. Also, take a look at visuals and captions. By analyzing these parts of the text, you should quickly get a sense of the main idea of the article. ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="633"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 2. ] Read the selection and then identify the main point of the selection, the point that the rest of the selection supports: this is the main idea. Read through the selection to identify the main idea. Sometimes, the main idea will be the first or second sentence of one of the first few paragraphs. Sometimes, it will be the last sentence of the first paragraph. Other times, no single sentence will tell you the main idea. You will have to come up with your own sentence answering the question, “What is the main point of this selection?” [ 3. ] Find details or statements within the selection that support or build on the main idea. Once you have identified the main idea, look for details that support the main idea. Many or most of the details should be related to the main idea. If you find that many of the details are not related to what you think is the main idea, you may not have identified the main idea correctly. Identify the main idea that the details in the selection support. Analyze the information in the text by finding the main idea and supporting details. Summarize When you analyze information by summarizing, you restate the main points of a passage in your own words. Using your own words helps you understand the information. Summarizing will help you understand a text and prepare for tests or assignments based on the text. Practice this skill by following the steps to summarize the excerpt on this page. Today, many countries are undergoing economic transition. Some are enjoying rapid growth, while others are changing their entire economic systems. Some places that are experiencing rapid economic change are Russia, China, India, and the countries of Africa and Latin America. For many nations, economic transition has meant moving from central planning to a market-based economy. In a command economy, the government owns and controls the factors of production. By contrast, in a market-based economy, the factors of production are owned and controlled by individuals. One of the first steps, then, in moving to a market economy is to sell or transfer government-owned businesses to individuals. This process is called privatization. [ 1. ] Identify and write down the main point of each paragraph in your own words. You may identify the main idea right at the beginning of each paragraph. In other cases, you will have to figure out the main idea. As you read each paragraph, ask yourself, “What is the point this paragraph makes?” The point the paragraph makes is the main idea. Write this idea down in your own words. Savvas.com/FloridaSSView Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 567 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="634"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 2. ] Use these main points to write a general statement of the overall main idea of the passage in your own words. Once you have written down the main idea for each paragraph, write down the main idea of the passage. Write the main idea in your own words. If you have trouble identifying the main idea of the passage, review the titles and headings in the passage. Often, titles and headings relate to the main idea. Also, the writer may state the main idea in the first paragraph of the passage. The main idea of a passage should answer the question, “What is the point this passage makes?” [ 3. ] Use this general statement as a topic sentence for your summary. Then, write a paragraph tying together the main points of the passage. Leave out unimportant details. Analyze the information in the passage by summarizing. Use the main idea of the passage as a topic sentence for your summary paragraph. Use the main ideas that you identified for each paragraph of the passage to write sentences supporting the main idea of the passage. Leave out details that are not needed to understand the main idea of the passage. Your summary should be in your own words, and it should be much shorter than the original passage. Once your summary is written, review it to make sure that it contains all the main points of the passage. If any are missing, revise your summary to include them. If the summary includes unimportant details, remove them. Generalize One good way to analyze materials about a particular subject is to make generalizations and predictions. What are the patterns and connections that link the different materials? What can you say about the different materials that is true of all them? Practice this skill by reading the following statements. What generalization can you make about the role of the government in the marketplace? &bull; The Federal Trade Commission Act says that advertisements cannot be deceptive. &bull; The Truth-in-Lending Act requires businesses offering loans to disclose certain information to consumers before they sign a loan agreement. &bull; The Federal Reserve System regulates banking and manages money supply. &bull; The Food and Drug Administration sets standards for food, drugs, and cosmetics. [ 1. ] Make a list. Listing all of the specific details and facts about a subject will help you find patterns and connections. [ 2. ] Generate a statement. From your list of facts and specific details, decide what most of the items listed have in common. Analyze your information by making generalizations and predictions. [ 3. ] Ensure your generalization is logical and well supported by facts. Generalizations can be valid or invalid. A generalization that is not logical or supported by facts is invalid. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="635"> <text><![CDATA[ Make Predictions You can analyze information by making generalizations and predictions. Predictions are educated guesses about the future, based on clues you find in written material and information you already have. When you analyze information by making generalizations and predictions, you are thinking critically about the material you read. Practice this skill by analyzing the chart below and predicting the effect an economic downturn, with lower corporate and individual earnings, would have on government receipts. Federal Receipts, 2014 (Estimated) 3% 6%46% 11% 34% SOURCE: Office of Management and Budget Individual income taxes Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and other retirement receipts Corporate income taxes Excise Taxes Customs, estate, gift, and other taxes [ 1. ] Review the content. Read your material carefully and research any terms or concepts that are new to you. It&apos;s important to understand the material before analyzing the information to make a prediction. [ 2. ] Look for clues. Gathering evidence is an important part of making predictions. Look for important words, statements, and evidence that seem to support the writer&apos;s point of view. Ask questions about what you are reading, including who, what, where, when, why, and how. Look for and analyze clues to help you generalize and predict. [ 3. ] Consider what you already know. Use related prior knowledge and/or connect to your own experiences to help you make an informed prediction. If you have experience with the subject matter, you have a much better chance of making an accurate prediction. [ 4. ] Generate a list of predictions. After studying the content, list the clues you&apos;ve found. Then use these clues, plus your prior knowledge, to form your predictions. List as many possible outcomes as you can based on clues in the material and the questions you have considered. 21st Century Skills 569 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="636"> <text><![CDATA[ Draw Inferences What is the author trying to tell you? To make a determination about the author&apos;s message, you analyze information by drawing inferences and conclusions. You consider details and descriptions included in the text, compare and contrast the text to prior knowledge you have about the subject, and then form a conclusion about the author&apos;s intent. Practice this skill by analyzing the document below and drawing inferences about the author&apos;s view of the Soviet economy under communism in 1931. The fear of being exiled [banished, sent away] as a kulak [a landowner] has been a powerful factor in drawing workers into the collective farms. In the Stalin kolkhoz [collective farm] where I stayed, a sharp-eyed dark-haired peasant approached me in the Village Soviet hut. We were in the presence of the Communist president. He spoke to me of the successes of the kolkhoz, of the enthusiasm for the collective farm movement, and of the affection of the peasants for their young Bolshevist leader. Next morning, however, when far away from any of the Communist members of the kolkhoz, the same peasant . . . approached me and whispered, “It is terrible here in the kolkhoz. We cannot speak or we shall be sent away to Siberia. . . . We are afraid. I had three cows. They took them away and now I only get a crust of bread. It is a thousand times worse now than before the Revolution. . . . We have to keep quiet. &ndash;“The Real Russia: The Peasant on the Farm,” Gareth Jones, The Times, October 14, 1931 [ 1. ] Study the image or text. Consider all of the details and descriptions included. What is the author trying to tell you? Look for context clues that hint at the topic and subject matter. [ 2. ] Make a connection. Use related prior knowledge to connect to the text or image. Analyze information by asking questions such as who, what, where, when, and how. Look for cause-and-effect relationships; compare and contrast. This strategy will help you think beyond the available surface details to understand what the author is suggesting or implying. [ 3. ] Form a conclusion. When you draw an inference, you combine your own ideas with evidence and details you found within the text or image to form a new conclusion. This action leads you to a new understanding of the material. Draw Conclusions When you analyze information by drawing inferences and conclusions, you connect the ideas in a text with what you already know in order to understand a topic better. Using this skill, you can “fill in the blanks” to see the implications or larger meaning of the information in a text. Practice this skill by reading the excerpt. What conclusions can you draw based on the information in the paragraph? ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="637"> <text><![CDATA[ Challenging Economic Times From the Oval Office, Hoover worked hard to end the depression. But to many out-of-work Americans, the President became a symbol of failure. Some people blamed capitalism, while others questioned the responsiveness of democracy. Many believed the American system was due for an overhaul. Although some questioned the ability of America&apos;s capitalistic and democratic institutions to overcome the crisis, most Americans never lost faith in their country. [ 1. ] Identify the topic, main idea, and supporting details. Before reading, look at the titles and headings within a reading. This should give you a good idea of the topic, or the general subject, of a text. After reading, identify the main idea. The main idea falls within the topic and answers the question, “What is the main point of this text?” Find the details that the author presents to support the main idea. [ 2. ] Use what you know to make a judgment about the information. Think about what you know about this topic or a similar topic. For example, you may read that the English settlers of Jamestown suffered from starvation because many of them were not farmers and did not know how to grow food. Analyzing the information about their situation and what you know about people, you could draw the conclusion that these settlers must have had little idea, or the wrong idea, about the conditions that they would find in America. [ 3. ] Check and adjust your judgment until you can draw a well-supported conclusion. Look for details within the reading that support your judgment. Reading a little further, you find that these settlers thought that they would become rich after discovering gold or silver, or through trading with Native Americans for furs. You can use this information to support your conclusion that the settlers were mistaken about the conditions that they would find in America. By analyzing the information further, you might infer that the settlers had inaccurate information about America. To support your conclusions, you could look for reliable sources on what these settlers knew before they left England. Interpret Sources Outlines and reports are good sources of information. In order to interpret these sources, though, you&apos;ll need to identify the type of document you&apos;re reading, identify the main idea, organize the details of information, and evaluate the source for point of view and bias. Practice this skill by finding a newspaper or online report on U.S. unemployment. What steps will you take to interpret this report? [ 1. ] Identify the type of document. Is the document a primary or secondary source? Determine when, where, and why it was written. 21st Century Skills 571 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="638"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 2. ] Examine the source to identify the main idea. After identifying the main idea, identify details or sections of text that support the main idea. If the source is an outline or report, identify the topic and subtopics; review the supporting details under each subtopic. Organize the information from the outline or report and think about how it connects back to the overall topic listed at the top of the outline or report. [ 3. ] Evaluate the source for point of view and bias. Primary sources often have a strong point of view or bias; it is important to analyze primary sources critically to determine their validity. Evaluating each source will help you interpret the information they contain. Create Databases Databases are organized collections of information which can be analyzed and interpreted. You decide on a topic, organize data, use a spreadsheet, and then pose questions which will help you to analyze and interpret your data. Practice this skill by creating a database of features for five different smartphones. Analyze your database to decide which one would best meet your needs. [ 1. ] Decide on a topic. Identify the information that you will convert into a table. This information may come from various sources, including textbooks, refer ence works, and Internet sites. [ 2. ] Organize the data. Study the information and decide what to include in your table. Only include data that is pertinent and available. Based on the data you choose, organize your information. Identify how many columns there will be and what the column headings will be. Decide the order in which you are going to list the data in the rows. [ 3. ] Use a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is a computer software tool that allows you to organize data so that it can be analyzed. Spreadsheets allow you to make calculations as well as input data. Use a spreadsheet to help you create summaries of your data. For instance, you can compute the sum, average, minimum, and maximum values of the data. Use the graphing features of your spreadsheet program to show the data visually. [ 4. ] Analyze the data. Once all of your data is entered and you have made any calculations you need, you are ready to pose questions to analyze and interpret your data. Organize the information from the database and use it to form conclusions. Be sure to draw conclusions that can be supported by the data available.

[ 2. ] Determine consistencies and inconsistencies, to see whether there is a trend in a graph, chart, or table. Organize information from visuals such as charts and graphs and decide whether or not there is a trend or pattern in the information that you see. Evaluate the data and determine whether the trend is consistent, or steady. Remember that there could be some inconsistencies, or exceptions to the pattern. Try not to miss the overall pattern because of a couple of exceptions. [ 3. ] Draw conclusions about the data in a chart, graph, or table. Once you under- stand the information, try to analyze and interpret the information and draw conclusions. If you see a pattern, does the pattern help you to understand the topic or predict future events? 574 21st Century Skills 21st Century SkillsRead Charts, Graphs, and Tables If you pose and answer questions about charts, graphs, or tables you find in books or online, you can find out all sorts of information, such as how many calories are in your favorite foods or what the value of a used car is.

Does the data in the chart or graph help you answer questions you have about the topic or see any causes or effects? For example, you could use your mathematical skills to create circle graphs or bar graphs that visually organize the data in a different way that allows you to interpret the data differently. [ 5. ] Use the data or information in charts and graphs to understand an issue or make decisions. Use your social studies skills to make inferences, draw conclusions, and take a stand on the issue. Create Charts and Maps MAFS.K12.MP.1.1 Thematic charts, graphs, and maps are visual tools for representing information. When you create a thematic chart, graph, or map you will start by selecting the type of data you want to represent. Then you will find appropriate data to include, organize your data, and then create symbols and a key to help others understand your chart, graph, or map. Practice this skill by creating an economic activity map of your state. Use computer software to generate the state outline, then apply appropriate symbols to represent the major industries of the state. [ 1. ] To create a chart or map, first select a region or set of data. Use a map to represent data pertaining to a specific region or location; use a chart to represent trends reflected in a set of data. [ 2. ] Research and find the data you would like to present in the chart or map. Your choice of data will be based on the theme you wish to explore. For example, a chart or map that explores the theme of changing demographics in Texas might include data about the location of different ethnic groups in Texas in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. [ 3. ] Organize the data according to the specific format of your chart or map. [ 4. ] Create symbols, a key (as needed), and a title. Create symbols to represent each piece of data you would like to highlight. Keep each symbol simple and easy to understand. After you have created the symbols, place them in a key. Add a title to your map or chart that summarizes the information presented. Your symbols and key will make it easier for others to interpret your charts and maps. Analyze Political Cartoons Political cartoons are visual commentaries about events or people. As you learn to analyze political cartoons, you will learn to identify bias in cartoons and interpret their meaning. You can start by carefully examining the cartoon and considering its possible meanings. Then you can draw conclusions based on your analysis. Practice this skill as you study the political cartoon. 21st Century Skills 575 ]]></text>

A map&apos;s title can help you to identify the region covered by the map. The title may also tell you the type of information you will find on the map. If the map has no title, you can identify the region by reading the labels on the map. [ 2. ] Use the map key to interpret symbols and colors on a map. A key or legend often appears in a small box near the edge of the map. The legend will tell you the meaning of colors, symbols, or other patterns on the map. On a physical map, colors from the key often show elevation, or height above sea level, on the map. [ 3. ] Identify physical features, such as mountains, valleys, oceans, and rivers. Using labels on the map and colors and symbols from the key, identify the physical features on the map. The information in the key allows you to interpret the information from visuals such as a map. Rivers, oceans, lakes, and other bodies of water are usually colored blue. Colors from the key may indicate higher and lower elevation, or there may be shading on the map that shows mountains. [ 4. ] Draw conclusions about the region based on natural resources and physical features. Once you understand all the symbols and colors on the map, try to interpret the information from the map. Is it very mountainous or mostly flat? Does it have a coastline? Does the region have lots of lakes and rivers that suggest a good water supply? Pose and answer questions about geographic distributions and patterns shown on the map. Physical maps can give you an idea of lifestyle and economic activities of people in the region. 21st Century Skills 577 ]]></text>

To find out, you could look at a political map. Political maps are colorful maps that show borders, or lines dividing states or countries. Practice reading political maps by studying the map below. [ 1. ] Identify the title of the political map and the region shown. A map&apos;s title can help you identify the region covered by the map. The title may also tell you the type of information you will find on the map. If the map has no title, you can identify the region by reading the labels on the map. [ 2. ] Use the map key to interpret symbols and colors on the map. A key or legend often appears in a small box near the edge of the map. The key will help you interpret information from visuals, including maps, by telling you the meaning of colors, symbols, or other patterns on the visual. [ 3. ] Identify boundaries between nations or states. Evaluate government data, such as borders, using the map. It is often easy to see borders, because each state or country will be a different color. If you cannot find the borders, check the key to find the lines used to mark borders on the map. [ 4. ] Locate capital cities. Look at the key to see whether capital cities are shown on the map. They are often marked with a special symbol, such as a star. [ 5. ] Draw conclusions about the region based on the map. Once you understand all the symbols and colors on the map, use appropriate reading and mathematical skills to interpret social studies information, such as that shown on the map, in order to draw conclusions about the region.

Once you understand all the symbols and colors on the map, you can use appropriate skills, including reading and mathematical skills, to analyze and interpret social studies information such as maps. You can pose and answer questions about geographic patterns and distributions that are shown on maps. For example, a precipitation or climate map will show you which areas get lots of rainfall and which are very dry. You can evaluate government and economic data using maps. For example, a population map will show you which regions have lots of people and which have small, scattered populations. A historical map will show you the locations of ancient empires or trade routes. Thematic maps focus on a single theme or topic about a region. For example, you can interpret information from a thematic map representing various aspects of Texas during the nineteenth or twentieth century by studying the Great Military Map, which shows forts established in Texas during the nineteenth century, or by studying a map covering Texas during the Great Depression and World War II. By mapping this kind of detailed information, special-purpose maps can help you understand a region&apos;s history or geography.

A map&apos;s title can help you to identify the region covered by the map. The title may also tell you the type of information you will find on the map. If the map has no title, you can identify the region by reading the labels on the map. [ 2. ] Use the compass rose to determine direction. Although on most maps north is at the top of the map, you should always double check the compass rose. Often, on the compass rose, the first letter of each direction represents that direction. For example, “N” represents the direction “north.” Some compass roses are as simple as an arrow pointing north. [ 3. ] Use the scale to estimate the distance between places. Use appropriate mathematical skills to interpret social studies information such as a map scale. The scale on a map shows how a measurement on the map compares to the distance on the ground. For example, if one inch on the map represents a mile, the number of inches between two places on the map is the distance in miles. [ 4. ] Use the key or legend on a map to find information about colors or symbols on a map. A key or legend often appears in a small box near the edge of the map. The legend will tell you the meaning of colors, symbols, or other patterns on the map. [ 5. ] Use the latitude and longitude grid to determine absolute locations. An absolute location is an exact description of a location on Earth&apos;s surface based on latitude and longitude. You can use the latitude and longitude lines on a map to find the absolute location of a place. Analyze Primary and Secondary Sources Primary sources are firsthand accounts of events. By contrast, secondary sources are secondhand accounts of events. Both sources are useful, but it is important to differentiate between valid primary and secondary sources. In this lesson, you&apos;ll learn how to locate and use primary and secondary sources to acquire information about the United States. Practice this skill by analyzing the two images below and distinguishing between the primary and the secondary sources.

    <page pageNumber="648"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 1. ] Determine who created the source as well as when and why it was created. Determine whether it is a primary or secondary source. Identify the author of the document. Next, look for the date the document was written or the date when the document was first published. Most primary sources are written close to the date of the events described. Secondary sources are often written well after the events described. Firsthand observers or participants in an event create primary sources. People who did not witness an event create secondary sources. Primary sources record an event. Secondary sources analyze or draw conclusions about events. Secondary sources rely on both primary and secondary sources. Good research requires you to analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments from a primary or secondary source for frame of reference. [ 2. ] Identify the central idea and key details, and determine whether they are facts or opinions. Read the text carefully and ask yourself, “What overall point is this text making?” This point is the main idea. Then reread the text and cite specific details that support this main idea. What insights do these details give you into the text as a whole? In a sentence or two, summarize the relationships among key details and ideas. Decide whether key details are facts or opinions. Facts can usually be confirmed in other sources. Opinions are often characterized by emotional language that shows feelings. [ 3. ] Decide whether the source&apos;s information is biased or if it is accurate and credible. Check statements in the text against reliable sources, such as encyclopedias or books written by experts on the topic. If reliable sources agree with the text, it is probably fairly accurate. If most of the text seems to be opinions rather than facts, it is not an accurate source of information. Still, these opinions can teach you about the author&apos;s world. A writer who observed an exciting or scary event may use emotional language to describe the event, but the source may still be a reliable account. An important part of research is analyzing and evaluating the validity of the information, arguments, and counterarguments from primary and secondary sources for bias or propaganda. Compare Viewpoints When people disagree about a topic, they have different viewpoints. Knowing how to analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments from both primary and secondary sources for point of view can help you to learn more about a topic. Practice this skill by reading the following quotes and comparing the viewpoints. “A college degree is worth it. College graduates make an average of 84 percent more over the course of a lifetime than those who only attend high school. The unemployment rate for young college grads is under 5 percent compared to more than 13 percent for those with only a high school diploma.” –Julie Margetta Morgan, Policy Analyst with the Postsecondary Education Program at the Center for American Progress ]]></text>

About 40 percent do not make it through a four-year bachelor&apos;s degree program in even six years. Others who major in subjects with low vocational demands often have trouble getting jobs.” –Richard Vedder, Director of Center for College Affordability and Productivity [ 1. ] Identify the authors of texts presenting different points of view and identify each author&apos;s frame of reference. Frame of reference is a term that describes the experiences, values, and ideas that influence a person&apos;s opinions and actions. It can also be referred to as point of view. First, identify the group or individual that wrote each text. Determine if the source is primary or secondary. As you read, take note of any information about the author&apos;s experiences or background. Also, look for any signs of what the author thinks is important. These types of statements can help you analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments from both primary and secondary sources for point of view. [ 2. ] Recognize any similarities and differences between the authors&apos; frames of reference and identify the opinion of each author. Pay attention to any similarities and differences between the two authors&apos; experiences, values, and ideas. Read carefully to identify the opinion of each author. In an article about a rock band, an author who played guitar in a band for ten years argues that Band A is the best band today because of its great guitarist. In a second article, another author who sang for many years argues that Band B is the best because of its lead singer. Notice how authors&apos; arguments and counterarguments are shaped by their frame of reference, or point of view. [ 3. ] Draw conclusions about similarities and differences between authors&apos; points of view. With some information about the point of view of each author, you can understand why they have different opinions. This helps you to analyze and evaluate the validity of the information, arguments, and counterarguments. In the example of the two authors writing about rock bands, each author stresses his or her own areas of expertise. You might decide to listen to the band recommended by the singer if you share an interest in vocals. If you are more interested in instrumentals, you might choose the band recommended by the guitarist. Identify Bias LAFS.1112.SL.1.3 Being able to analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments for bias helps you to determine whether primary or secondary sources you find online, in books, or in the media are reliable. When you are able to identify bias in written, oral, and visual material, you can see when someone is presenting only one side of an issue or basing an argument on emotion instead of facts. Practice this skill whenever you read or hear a politician describing an economic policy. Savvas.com/FloridaSSView Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 583 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="650"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 1. ] Identify the author of a source and the author&apos;s purpose. First, identify the author of the source. The author may be a group or an organization rather than a single person. The author may state his or her purpose very clearly in the source. If not, the type of source may give you an idea of the purpose. For example, the writer of an encyclopedia aims to summarize information about a subject. The author of a political Web site may want you to vote for a candidate. [ 2. ] Identify the main idea, and check whether the main idea is supported with facts or opinions. Read the document carefully and ask yourself, “What is the main point of this selection?” Your answer to this question is the main idea. Reread the document and list details that support this main idea. Decide whether these details are facts or opinions. To find out whether they are facts, check whether other reliable sources include the same information. If your source uses statements that shows feelings, those statements are probably opinions. [ 3. ] Look for the use of emotional language or one-sided opinions. Look for words that can show opinions such as “good” and “bad.” Be aware of statements that make you feel angry, scared, or excited. Also, watch out for statements that only express one side of an issue. These are all signs of bias. [ 4. ] Draw conclusions about the author&apos;s bias, if any. Is the author using mostly emotional language with few facts to support his or her ideas? Are there insults or other very negative language in the source? If so, the source is probably biased. Similarly, if you notice that the author is presenting only one side of an issue, the source is probably not reliable. It is important to analyze and evaluate the information, arguments, and counterarguments in both primary and secondary sources for bias. Evaluate Existing Arguments LAFS.1112.RH.3.8 When you evaluate existing arguments, you must evaluate and analyze the point of view and biases of your sources and their authors. Who is the author and what is he or she trying to accomplish? How valid are the arguments in your primary and secondary sources? If you master these skills, you will be able to analyze and interpret social studies information such as speeches. Practice this skill as you read and evaluate the this excerpt. . . . Independence for the Gold Coast was my aim. It was a colony, and I have always regarded colonialism as the policy by which a foreign power binds territories to herself by political ties with the primary object of promoting her own economic advantage. . . .

What other countries have taken three hundred years or more to achieve, a once dependent territory must try to accomplish in a generation if it is to survive. . . . &ndash;Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana: The Autobiography of Kwame Nkrumah, 1957 [ 1. ] Identify the claim or thesis. What is the author or source claiming? The claim or thesis is usually found in the introduction and/or conclusion of a written or spoken argument. [ 2. ] Identify the reasons (claims to truth or facts) the author offers in support of his or her claim. What evidence does the author or source provide to support their claims? Make a list of the evidence provided to support each claim. [ 3. ] Evaluate the argument. Analyze and evaluate the validity of the evidence presented to support each claim. Use the appropriate skills to analyze and interpret social studies information, such as speeches. Research each claim to be sure that the author&apos;s statements are accurate. Carefully check for evidence of bias or propaganda. Be sure you understand the author&apos;s point of view and his or her frame of reference. Finally, check to be sure that the author&apos;s conclusions follow logically from the evidence presented. If the evidence is accurate, the author is free from bias, and conclusions follow logically from the evidence, the claims are probably valid. Consider and Counter Opposing Arguments LAFS.1112.WHST.1.1 Before you can effectively counter opposing arguments, you&apos;ll need to analyze possible counterarguments for frame of reference, bias, point of view, and propaganda. You&apos;ll plan your response ahead of time, collecting research and data. Then, you&apos;ll make a point of acknowledging the opposing view before presenting your counterarguments. To practice this skill, suppose you are preparing for a debate about raising the minimum wage in your state. Choose a side of the debate to support. What arguments will you use to support your side of the debate? What counterarguments will you anticipate the other side using? Why is it useful to anticipate the other side&apos;s arguments? [ 1. ] Fully understand your argument and the potential counter points. Do research as needed to find out more about other opposing views. Analyze and evaluate the validity of possible counterarguments from primary and secondary sources for frame of reference, bias, point of view, and propaganda. [ 2. ] Make predictions and outline a response to several of the opposing views. Continue researching as needed. Researching, analyzing, and evaluating the validity of opposing arguments will help you support and strengthen your own. Opposing arguments can consist of any reasons, conclusions, or claims that oppose yours. Outline your response to each opposing reason, conclusion, or claim. 21st Century Skills 585 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="652"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 3. ] To counter an opposing argument, first acknowledge the opposing view. This strategy shows that you have heard the opposing argument and are responding accordingly. Consider using statements such as “I understand your point, but you should also consider the following...” You can also respond by refuting facts, logic, etc. Be sure to respond to each opposing argument. Ignoring or dismissing a counterargument shows that your response is weak and unsupported. Participate in a Discussion or Debate LAFS.1112.SL.1.1 When you participate in a collaborative discussion or debate, your goal is to explain, analyze, and defend a point of view. Use the steps below to hold a discussion on this question: Do you think the United States should act as a “global policeman?” Why or why not? To begin, hold a one-on-one discussion with a partner. Then work in a group to delve into the question more deeply. Finally, participate in a teacher-led discussion on this topic. [ 1. ] Prepare. Prepare for the discussion by reading and researching examples and opinions related to the role of the U.S. in the world. In your group, set clear goals and deadlines and establish individual roles, such as lead spokesperson and note keeper. Promote civil, democratic decision decision-making within your group. During the discussion, draw on your preparation by referring to evidence from texts and other research to stimulate a thoughtful, well-reasoned exchange of ideas. Build on others&apos; ideas and express your own clearly and persuasively. [ 2. ] Work with peers to promote civil, democratic discussions. Propel conversations by posing and responding to questions that probe reasoning and evidence; ensure a hearing for a full range of positions on a topic or issue; clarify, verify, or challenge ideas and conclusions; and promote divergent and creative perspectives. Respond thoughtfully to diverse perspectives. [ 3. ] Respond thoughtfully to diverse perspectives. Synthesize comments, claims, and evidence made on all sides of an issue; resolve contradictions when possible; and determine what additional information or research is required to deepen the investigation or complete the task. Give an Effective Presentation LAFS.1112.SL.2.4 When you create a written, visual, and oral presentation, you teach, convince, or share information with an audience. Effective presentations use both words and visuals to engage audiences. Delivery is also important. For example, you can use the way you move, speak, and look at the audience to keep people interested. Use the steps below to prepare and deliver a presentation on key economic indicators. ]]></text>

If this is a research report, you will need facts and data to support your points. If you are trying to persuade your audience, look for powerful photos. Keep your audience in mind. Consider their interests and present your topic in a way that will engage them. [ 2. ] Write the text and find visual aids for your presentation. Find information and images for your presentation in reliable sources. Organize the information and write it up carefully so that it is easy for your audience to understand. Address alternative or opposing points of view. Photos and diagrams will get people interested in the presentation. So choose large, colorful images that people in the back of the audience will be able to see. [ 3. ] Practice and work to improve your presentation. Keep practicing your oral presentation until you know the material well. Then, practice some more, focusing on improving your delivery. [ 4. ] Use body language, tone of voice, and eye contact to deliver an effective presentation. Answer questions if the audience has them. At the beginning of your oral presentation, take a breath, smile, and stand up tall. Speak more loudly and more clearly than you would in normal conversation. Also, try not to rush through the presentation. Glance at your notes but speak naturally, rather than reading. Look at people in the audience. If people are confused, pause to clarify. Finally, leave time for people in the audience to ask questions. LAFS.1112.WHST.1.2, LAFS.1112.WHST.2.4, Write an Essay LAFS.1112.WHST.2.5 An informative or explanatory essay is one in which the writer conveys or explains facts to his or her audience. An explanation of economic trends, such as the trends during 2016, is one type of informative text. To practice this skill, select a topic related to recent economic history to explain to your fellow classmates. Follow the steps below to write your essay. [ 1. ] Research. Develop the topic by selecting the most significant and relevant facts, extended definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples appropriate to your audience&apos;s knowledge of the topic. [ 2. ] Create an outline. Review all of the information you have gathered and decide how you want to organize your essay. You might order events chronologically, or perhaps you will organize them around an overriding theme. Be sure you address what is most significant for your overall purpose, as well as your audience. Organize complex ideas and information so that each new element builds on that which precedes it to create a unified whole. 21st Century Skills 587 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="654"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 3. ] Create a first draft. Use varied transitions and sentence structures to link the major sections of the text, create cohesion, and clarify the relationships among complex ideas and concepts. Use language and vocabulary appropriate for discussing economic trends. Try to incorporate techniques such as metaphor, simile, and analogy to manage the complexity of the topic. Include headings, tables, graphs, maps, and multimedia to aid comprehension. Provide a concluding statement or section that follows from and supports the information in your essay. [ 4. ] Revise. Develop and strengthen writing as needed by revising, editing, and rewriting. Try a new approach when necessary. Avoid Plagiarism LAFS.1112.WHST.3.8 When you don&apos;t attribute ideas and information to source materials and authors, you are plagiarizing. Plagiarizing–claiming others&apos; ideas and information as your own–is considered unethical. You can avoid plagiarizing by carefully noting down which authors and sources you&apos;ll be using, citing those authors and sources in your paper, and listing them in a bibliography. To practice this skill, suppose you have been assigned to write a research paper on the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Name three types of sources you might use to help you gather information. Explain how you will avoid plagiarism when you use these sources. [ 1. ] Keep a careful log of your notes. As you read sources to gain background information on your topic, keep track of ideas and information and the sources and authors they come from. Write down the name of each source next to your notes from that particular source so you can remember to cite it later on. Create a separate section in your notes where you keep your own thoughts and ideas so you know which ideas are your own. Using someone else&apos;s words or paraphrasing their ideas does not make them yours. [ 2. ] Cite sources in your paper. You must identify the source materials and authors you use to support your ideas. Whenever you use statistics, facts, direct quotations, or paraphrases of others&apos; views, you need to attribute them to your source. Cite your sources within the body of your paper. Check your assignment to find out how they should be formatted. [ 3. ] List your sources in a bibliography at the end of your paper. List your source materials and authors cited in alphabetical order by author, using accepted formats. As you work, be sure to check your list of sources from your notes so that none are left out of the bibliography. Solve Problems Problem solving is a skill that you use every day. It is a process that requires an open mind, clear thinking, and action. Suppose you found out that, compared to others in your company, you were being underpaid for the work you do. Practice this skill by using these steps to solve the problem of gaining a fair wage for yourself. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="655"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 1. ] Understand the problem. Before trying to solve a problem, make sure that you gather as much information as possible in order to identify the problem. What are the causes and effects of the problem? Who is involved? You will want to make sure that you understand different perspectives on the problem. Try not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions. You might end up misunderstanding the problem. [ 2. ] Consider possible solutions and choose the best one. Once you have identified the problem and gathered some information, list and consider a number of possible options. Right away, one solution might seem like the right one, but try to think of other solutions. Be sure to consider carefully the advantages and disadvantages of each option. It can help to take notes listing benefits and drawbacks. Look for the solution whose benefits outweigh its drawbacks. After considering each option, choose the solution you think is best. [ 3. ] Make and implement a plan. Choose and implement a solution. Make a detailed, step-by-step plan to implement the solution that you choose. Write your plan down and assign yourself a deadline for each step. That will help you to stay on track toward completing your plan. Try to think of any problems that might come up and what you will do to address those problems. Of course, there are many things that you cannot predict. Stay flexible. Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution and adjust your plan as necessary. Make Decisions Everyone makes decisions. The trick is to learn how to make good decisions. How can you make good decisions? First, identify a situation that requires a decision and gather information. Then, identify possible options and predict the consequences of each option. Finally, choose the best option and take action to implement a decision. Consider the benefits of getting a job: you gain experience and earn money. The trade-off, or cost, is that you give up time that you could spend studying, playing sports, or just relaxing. Practice this skill by using these steps to decide how to spend your allowance or earnings from a part time job. [ 1. ] Determine the options between which you must decide. In some cases, like ordering from a menu at a restaurant, your options may be clear. In other cases, you will need to identify a situation that requires a decision, gather information, and identify the options that are available to you. Spend some time thinking about the situation and brainstorm a number of options. If necessary, do a little research to find more options. Make a list of options that you might choose.

    <page pageNumber="656"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 2. ] Review the costs and benefits of each option. Carefully predict the consequences of each option. You may want to make a cost-benefit list for each option. To do this, write down the option and then draw two columns underneath it. One column will be the “pro” or benefit list. The other column will be the “con” or cost list. Note the pros and cons for each of your options. Try not to rush through this process. For a very important decision, you may even want to show your list to someone you trust. This person can help you think of costs and benefits that you had not considered. [ 3. ] Determine the best option and act on it. Look through your cost-benefit lists. Note any especially serious costs. If an option has the possibility of an extremely negative consequence, you might want to cross it off your list right away. Look closely at the options with the most benefits and the fewest costs, and choose the one that you think is best. Once you have made a choice, take action to implement a decision. If necessary, make a detailed plan with clear steps. Set a deadline to complete the steps to keep yourself moving toward your goal. Being an Informed Citizen Informed citizens understand the responsibilities, duties, and obligations of citizenship. They are well informed about civic affairs, involved with their communities, and politically active. When it comes to issues they personally care about, they take a stand and reach out to others. [ 1. ] Learn the issues. A great way to begin to understand the responsibilities of citizenship is to first find topics of interest to you. Next, become well informed about civic affairs in your town, city, or country. Read newspapers, magazines, and articles you find online about events happening in your area or around the world. Analyze the information you read to come to your own conclusions. Radio programs, podcasts, and social media are also great ways to keep up with current events and interact with others about issues. [ 2. ] Get involved. Attend community events to speak with others who know the issues. Become well informed about how policies are made and changed. Find out who to speak to if you would like to take part in civic affairs and policy creation. There are government websites that can help direct you to the right person. These websites will also provide his or her contact details. [ 3. ] Take a stand and reach out. Write, call, or meet with your elected officials to become a better informed, more responsible citizen. Do research about candidates who are running for office to be an informed voter. Start your own blog or website to explore issues, interact with others, and be part of the community or national dialogue.

    <page pageNumber="657"> <text><![CDATA[ Political Participation Political participation starts with an understanding of the responsibilities, duties and obligations of citizenship, such as serving the public good. When you understand your role as a political participant, you can get involved through volunteering for a political campaign, running for office, or interacting with others in person or online. [ 1. ] Volunteer for a political campaign. Political campaigns offer a wide variety of opportunities to help you become involved in the political process and become a responsible citizen by serving the public good. As a political campaign volunteer you may have the opportunity to attend events, make calls to voters, and explore your community while getting to know how other voters think about the responsibilities, duties, and obligations of citizenship. [ 2. ] Run for office in your school or community. A good way to become involved in your school or community is to run for office. Student council or community positions offer a great opportunity for you to become familiar with the campaign and election process. [ 3. ] Reach out to others. Start or join an interest group. Interest groups enable people to work together on common goals related to the political process. Write a letter or email to a public official. By contacting an elected official from your area, you can either support or oppose laws or policies. You can also ask for help or support regarding certain issues. [ 4. ] Interact online. Social networking sites and blogs offer a great way for people of all ages to interact and write about political issues. As you connect with others, you&apos;ll become more confident in your role as a citizen working for the public good. Voting Voting is not only a right. It is also one of the primary responsibilities, duties, and obligations of citizenship. Before you can legally vote, however, you must understand the voter registration process and the criteria for voting in elections. You should also understand the issues and know where different candidates stand on those issues. [ 1. ] Check eligibility and residency requirements. In order to vote in the United States, you must be a United States citizen who is 18 years or older, and you must be a resident of the place where you plan to vote. [ 2. ] Register to vote. You cannot vote until you understand the voter registration process. You can register at city or town election offices, or when you get a driver&apos;s license. You can also register by mail or online. You may also have the option of registering at the polls on Election Day, but this does not apply in all states. Make sure to find out what you need to do to register in your state, as well as the deadline for registering. You may have the option of declaring a political party when registering. 21st Century Skills 591 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="658"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 3. ] Learn the issues. As the election approaches, research the candidates and issues in order to be an informed voter. Watch televised debates, if there are any. You can also review the candidates&apos; websites. By doing these things and thinking critically about what you learn, you will be prepared to exercise your responsibility, duty and obligation as a United States citizen. [ 4. ] Vote. Make sure to arrive at the correct polling place on Election Day to cast your ballot. Research to find out when the polls will be open. Advance voting, absentee voting, and voting by mail are also options in certain states for those who qualify. Serving on a Jury As an American, you need to understand the duties, obligations and responsibilities of citizenship; among these is the expectation that you may be required to serve on a jury. You will receive a written notice when you are summoned to jury duty and you&apos;ll receive instruction on the special duties and obligations of a juror. You&apos;ll follow the American code of justice which assumes that a person is innocent until proven guilty, and you&apos;ll follow instructions about keeping trial information confidential. [ 1. ] Wait to receive notification. If you are summoned to serve as a juror, you will be first notified by mail. If you are chosen to move on to the jury selection phase, lawyers from both sides will ask you questions as they select the final jury members. It is an honor to serve as a juror, as it is a responsibility offered only to American citizens. [ 2. ] Follow the law and remain impartial. Your job is to determine whether or not someone broke the law. You may also be asked to sit on the jury for civil cases (as opposed to criminal cases); these cases involve lawsuits filed against individuals or businesses for any perceived wrong doing (such as broken contracts, trespassing, discrimination, etc.). Be sure to follow the law as it is explained to you, regardless of whether you approve of the law or not. Your decision about the trial should not be influenced by any personal bias or views you may have. [ 3. ] Remember that the defendant is presumed innocent. In a criminal trial, the defendant must be proven guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt” for the verdict to be guilty. If the trial team fails to prove the defendant to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury verdict must be “not guilty.” [ 4. ] During the trial, respect the court&apos;s right to privacy. As a juror, you have specific duties, obligations, and responsibilities under the law. Do not permit anyone to talk about the case with you or in your presence, except with the court&apos;s permission. Avoid media coverage once the trial has begun so as to prevent bias. Keep an open mind and do not form or state any opinions about the case until you have heard all of the evidence, the closing arguments from the lawyers, and the judge&apos;s instructions on the applicable law. ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="659"> <text><![CDATA[ Paying Taxes Paying taxes is one of the responsibilities of citizenship. How do you go about figuring out how much you&apos;ve already paid in taxes and how much you still owe? It&apos;s your duty and obligation to find out, by determining how much has been deducted from your pay and filing your tax return. [ 1. ] Find out how taxes are deducted from your pay. In the United States, payroll taxes are imposed on employers and employees, and they are collected and paid by the employers. Check your pay stub to find out how much money was deducted for taxes. Be sure to also save the W-2 tax form your employer sends to you. You will need this form later on when filing your tax paperwork. Also save any interest income statements. All this information will help you fulfill your obligation as an American taxpayer. [ 2. ] Check the sales taxes in your state. All but five states impose sales and use taxes on retail sale, lease, and rental of many goods, as well as some services. Sales tax is calculated as the purchase price times the appropriate tax rate. Tax rates vary widely from less than one percent to over ten percent. Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale. [ 3. ] File your tax return. Filing your tax return is more than an obligation: it&apos;s also a duty and responsibility of citizenship. You may receive tax forms in the mail, or pick them up at the local Post Office or library. Fill the forms in and then mail or electronically send completed tax forms and any necessary payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and your state&apos;s department of revenue. The IRS provides free resources to help people prepare and electronically file their tax returns; go to IRS.gov to learn more. Note: certain things such as charitable donations and business expenses are tax deductible. Savvas.com/FloridaSSView Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 593 ]]></text>
