Do you think that ratio will change in the future? Why or why not? Growth and Challenges in Africa and Latin America Like Asia, Africa and Latin America are home to many poor countries. Some nations in these two regions have seen great economic growth in recent years. Others continue to struggle. Continuing Poverty in Africa Some North African nations have built productive economies. This success is mainly due to large reserves of oil. South of the Sahara, however, most nations face the obstacles common to all less developed countries. Economies are largely based on subsistence farming. Low literacy rates, inadequate healthcare and nutrition, high rates of HIV infection, and mounting debt hinder development efforts. Some nations are also plagued by years of civil war or ethnic conflict. Only two African nations south of the Sahara have sizable economies&ndash;South Africa and Nigeria. Nigeria benefits from large reserves of oil. Yet over-dependence on oil has slowed growth in other areas. Nigeria also suffers from widespread political corruption and ethnic conflict. However, President Goodluck Jonathan, who became president in 2010, promised to reform the country&apos;s electoral process, tackle corruption, and resolve Nigeria&apos;s energy problems. In the 1990s, South Africa shifted from longtime rule by its white minority to black majority rule. Problems in this political transition, along with high rates of HIV infection, slowed economic growth. Unemployment remains high, and poverty remains a problem. Still, South Africa has one of the 25 highest GDPs in the world. It benefits from a rich array of natural resources and a strong manufacturing base. Different Paths in Latin America In Latin America, the two biggest success stories are Brazil and Mexico. Both countries have abundant resources. Both have also taken steps to make their economies more diverse. Brazil exports iron ore and timber, and its land and climate are highly suitable for growing coffee and soybeans. The discovery of large offshore oil reserves in late 2007 promises to turn Brazil into a major oil-exporting power. Oil production grew from around 2,300 barrels a day in 2007 to 2,600 barrels a day in 2012. Brazil has become a strong manufacturing power, producing everything from vehicles to shoes. It has also adapted its sugar industry to produce ethanol. Brazil builds cars that can run on either gasoline or ethanol. More than 40 percent of the fuel that powers Brazilian cars comes from ethanol derived from sugar cane. Mexico has reserves of oil and silver and produces rich crops of cotton and coffee.

By diversifying their economies, Mexico and Brazil have freed 80 percent or more of their labor forces from farm work. Employment in manufacturing and service industries has helped these two economies grow. Venezuela also has large reserves of oil. Its leadership turned in a different direction, though. President Hugo Chávez shifted the economy away from the market system to socialism. In addition to the oil industry, Chávez nationalized agricultural, financial, telecommunications, construction, and steel companies. He promised to use money derived from the sale of oil and gas to eliminate poverty and improve health and education. These advances have yet to be seen, however. The successor to Chávez, President Nicolás Maduro, is expected to continue along the same political path.

What Causes Globalization?
The economies of the world’s nations are interconnected in deep
and complex ways—and they will remain interconnected. The
global economy creates new issues that business managers,
workers, and government leaders must take into account. In this
lesson, you will look at many of these issues, from impact on the
environment to increased competition for American businesses.
The increasingly tight interconnection of producers,
consumers, and financial systems around the world is known as
globalization. Such connections are not a new phenomenon. In
the Middle Ages, the Asian spice trade connected Europe, Asia,
and Africa. The voyages of Columbus led to the colonization of the
Americas by European sea powers and to the development of the
African slave trade. The Age of Imperialism that began in the late
1800s forged even closer links between the economies of Europe
and the United States and those of Africa and Asia.
Still, globalization today is taking place at a much faster
pace than in the past. Several factors contribute to the evertightening links between economies around the world. They
include the development of faster methods of communication
and transportation, the widespread adoption of elements of the
free enterprise system, and the growth of international trade
agreements.

    <page pageNumber="542"> <text><![CDATA[ Transportation and Communication What do
the domestication of the camel, the invention of
the compass, and the creation of the Internet have
in common? All these innovations allowed greater
movement of products, people, and ideas. Today,
as in the past, globalization depends on breaking
through barriers of time and space.
In the past, camels and ships made it possible
to trade across vast deserts and oceans. Today, jet
airplanes allow producers to sell goods in distant
markets that would have been impossible to reach
quickly in the past. For example, flower growers in
the Netherlands or Colombia can send fresh flowers
for sale in the United States.
Today’s communications revolution has also
sped up the pace of globalization. Thanks to
satellite communications, customers and suppliers
on opposite sides of the world can talk quickly
and clearly. Computers give people greater access
to information about the availability and prices
of products in distant countries. Investors in one
country can get up-to-date information and use it to
buy stocks on financial markets anywhere.
Expansion of the Free Market As you read
earlier, many nations have moved away from central planning. Even some communist governments have
chosen to pursue free market policies. As a result,
the proportion of the world that practices free market
economics has more than tripled. At the same time,
the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe has allowed nations that had once
been locked out of world trade to enter the global
marketplace.
The new free market economies are more open
to foreign investment. In 1975, the value of foreign
direct investment worldwide totaled only about $23
billion. By 2012, the total had grown to $1.4 trillion.
The opening of new markets has created new
investment opportunities as countries across the
globe learn the benefits of a free enterprise system. It
has also created new global economic ties.
Trade Agreements Earlier, you read that many
nations have signed regional trade agreements.
This is another example of the role of government in
economic systems. Some trade agreements, such as
the Trans-Pacific Partnership under consideration in
2014, must pass both houses of Congress to become
law.

However, the combinedoutput of the 28 nations that make up the European Union (EU) is competitive with that of the United States. The democratically elected governments of the EU recognize the benefits of free enterprise and of trading blocs. People, goods, and services can flow freely among members of the EU, making it almost like a single economy. Concern about competition from the EU was one of the factors that spurred the United States, Canada, and Mexico to sign the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). With the passage of NAFTA and the lowering of trade barriers, businesses had increased incentives to take part in regional trade. Trading blocs do not remain fixed. The EU has repeatedly expanded to include more nations. It is also working to forge trade ties with other regions. All of this activity has added to the tighter globalization of the world economy. IdENTIfy CENTRAL IdEAS How have modern communications contributed to globalization? Challenges of Globalization “Arguing against globalization,” said former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, “is like arguing against the laws of gravity.” While globalization is a fact of modern economic life, it has also created challenges. Closely Linked Financial Markets In 2007 and 2008, many American financial firms lost money&ndash; or went out of business&ndash;as a result of making too many risky home mortgage loans. Worried that the crisis would cause a downturn in the economy, investors sold stocks. Heavy losses on the New York Stock Exchange raised concerns among investors elsewhere in the world. They, in turn, sold stocks on European and Asian exchanges. The ripple effect caused by this American financial crisis is not unique. In recent decades, economic problems in Mexico, Japan, Russia, and Argentina had a similar impact on world financial markets. Why do financial problems in one country affect people in another? The reason is that world financial markets are closely connected.

They move quickly to buy the stock of promising companies in whatever country they find them&ndash;and sell just as quickly at any sign of trouble. Another reason for the widespread impact of these financial crises is the booming trade in currencies on foreign exchange markets. As you read earlier, most of the world now follows a flexible exchange-rate system. The values of various national currencies go up or down every day. Investors holding money in a particular currency sell it off if the value of that currency declines. As sales of a country&apos;s currency mount, its economy will suffer. These effects do not just hurt investors who risk their money in the hope of making profits. They have an impact on ordinary people as well. Banks buy assets in other countries. If the value of those assets falls, the banks have less capital available to make loans to people in their own countries. Multinational Corporations As you read in an earlier Lesson, the expansion of multinational corporations has sparked controversy. Some economists argue that these companies have a beneficial impact on the countries in which they set up operations. For example, multinationals have been >> Hyundai Motor Company is a Korean multinational with automobile factories and showrooms in the United States and other nations around the world, including the Czech Republic and Russia. credited with much of the development of Eastern Europe after the fall of communism: [Multinationals] brought countless benefits. These include . . . improving the environment; rescuing collapsing factories and rotting company towns; establishing new industries; laying new telecommunications networks; stabilizing banking systems . . . and facing down corrupt vested interests in governments that in too many cases had plundered their own countries. &ndash;Paul Lewis, “Harnessing the Power of the Multinationals” Multinationals have the capital to introduce technology to developing countries, offer jobs, train the labor force, and provide the opportunity for related services and industries to develop. Critics, however, claim that multinationals do little to aid less developed countries. Some point out that most of the profits go not to the host LDC, but to the foreign owners of the corporation. Others say that multinationals create far fewer job opportunities than they claim. Many of the industries are highly mechanized, allowing high productivity with little labor. Thus, they provide few jobs relative to the massive size of the labor pool and may even drive traditional craftworkers out of business. Another area of controversy is wages. Generally, wages in less developed countries are very low compared with wages in industrialized nations. Supporters argue that the lower wages are justified since the cost of living in LDCs is also relatively low. In addition, many of the people employed by multinationals might not have jobs otherwise. Critics argue that multinationals benefit unfairly from the low wages. Also, many LDCs do not require companies to provide the same high standard of working conditions that industrialized countries require. Loss of Jobs Much of the debate over multinationals and globalization focuses on the impact on less developed countries. However, people in developed nations are equally concerned about a related issue&ndash;the loss of jobs. 478 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="545"> <text><![CDATA[ In the global economy, companies may move parts of their operations to other countries. This practice is known as offshoring. Offshoring may involve a single process, as when an American bank hires a call center in India or Kenya to handle its telemarketing. Or it can be total, as when a multinational manufacturer closes a plant in the United States to build one in another country, where labor is cheaper. In either case, the result is job loss. As you learned earlier, movement of jobs overseas is one of the key causes of structural unemployment. IdENTIfy CAUSE ANd EffECT What problems can result when financial markets are interconnected? Migration People have always moved from place to place in hopes of building a better life. Globalization and development have accelerated these population shifts. Domestic Migration Much of this migration takes place domestically, within a nation&apos;s borders. In many less developed countries, cities offer more job opportunities than rural areas. As a result, large numbers of people in villages are streaming into cities. By 2012, more than 40 percent of the people in Africa and Asia lived in cities. Today, 22 of the world&apos;s 30 largest cities are located in less developed countries. Each of them has more than 10 million people. Rapid urbanization has caused several problems. Cities have grown so fast that they cannot provide enough housing, schools, or sanitation for all of their inhabitants. Poverty, crime, and disease are widespread. International Migration Each year, millions of workers leave less developed countries in the hopes of finding jobs in developed nations. This international migration has an economic impact on both the source country and the destination country. Most immigrants come legally, with proper visas and proof that they have jobs waiting for them. Although their labor contributes to a country&apos;s GDP, they may face resentment from native-born workers who view the newcomers as competition for jobs. Other people come without legal authorization. Illegal immigration raises security concerns and puts a strain on public resources. >> Rapid urbanization has led to the development of densely populated slums in some cities, including São Paulo, Brazil&apos;s largest city. >> When scientists or other professionals emigrate, their home country is hurt in two ways.

    <page pageNumber="546"> <text><![CDATA[ Migration also affects the source country. Once they find work, many immigrants send regular cash payments to their families back home. These remittances provide an important source of income. The World Bank estimated that, in 2013 alone, the value of remittances to LDCs totaled $410 billion. At the same time, many well-trained and educated people also leave LDCs for well-paying jobs in developed nations. This “brain drain” may hurt development by siphoning off vital human capital. Identi fy Cause an d Effect How does migration affect less developed countries? Ongoing Issues Globalization has created new opportunities but also new challenges for the world&apos;s economies. Some of these challenges have become sources of tension between the developed world and the developing world. Issues related to equal treatment and the environment are key causes of conflict, as is competition for scarce resources. A Greater Voice for the Developing World Leaders in less developed countries argue that international trade and financial policies favor the wealthier nations. In an effort to give emerging economies a greater voice, 19 countries plus the European Union have formed an organization called the Group of 20, or G20. The G20 includes officials from growing nations such as China, South Korea, Russia, India, South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as from the United States and Europe. The G20 has discussed such issues as promoting growth and combating the financing of terrorist operations. Environment Versus Development The environment can be another source of tension. Environmental scientists&ndash;mostly based in developed nations&ndash;worry that rapid development can cause environmental damage. They seek to promote sustainable development, that is, the goal of meeting current development needs without using up the resources needed by future generations. On the other hand, government leaders in many less developed nations see an urgent need to exploit their resources now. They view combating poverty and creating modern economies as a higher priority than protecting the environment. Developed nations, they argue, were able to use resources such as oil without restriction. LDCs now seek the same opportunity. One major issue is deforestation, or largescale destruction of forests. Many developing nations are cutting down forests at a rapid rate.

Environmentalists warn that deforestation contributes to global warming and destroys rare animal and plant species. Competition for Resources A related challenge is competition for scarce resources. In some regions, it is increasingly difficult to find enough clean water to meet the needs of a growing population. In China, for example, rapid population growth and economic growth have led to serious contamination of an already uncertain water supply. Some experts warn that reserves of oil and gas are dwindling as well. They fear that unless new sources of these fuels&ndash;or different sources of energy&ndash;are found, the world&apos;s economies may grind to a halt. Case Study: The Atlantic Bluefin Tuna The Atlantic bluefin tuna is one of the world&apos;s most popular tunas. Although the Atlantic bluefin lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the main market for the bluefin is Japan, where it is often eaten as sushi. For many years, fishers from many countries caught Atlantic bluefins faster than they could reproduce. In 1969, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was formed to manage Atlantic tuna fisheries. However, for many years, ICCAT, under pressure from countries whose fishers depended on tuna, allowed tuna catches greater than the ability of tuna to reproduce. Environmentalists called the ICCAT “the International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna.” Finally, in 2009, as bluefin stocks fell to alarmingly low levels, and as more and more people realized that the bluefin could face extinction, the ICCAT issued much lower catch quotas. Still, fishers from some countries caught more bluefins than the quotas allowed. To try to enforce quotas, starting in 2011, member nations agreed to monitor catches by their fishers. By 2012, these new policies began to show some success. According to some measures, Atlantic bluefin stocks increased slightly for the first time since recordkeeping began. Different Perspectives on Resources There are two types of natural resources. Renewable resources are resources that replenish themselves naturally over the course of years or decades. Examples include timber from forests, sustainably harvested fish, and agricultural crops. Nonrenewable resources are resources that have a finite supply and that cannot be replaced or take millions of years to replace. Examples include coal, >> More than half of the world&apos;s rain forests, including huge areas of Brazil&apos;s Amazon, have been cut or burned to meet the demand for arable land and wood.

minerals.
People in different parts of the United States and
around the world have different perspectives on the
use of these resources. For example, many people
in developing nations rich in fossil fuels believe in
extracting and selling those fuels to support their
economies, while some people in developed nations
believe that limits should be set on the use of those
fuels to protect the climate.
In the United States, people differ in their
views on fossil fuel extraction, too. Some think that
undersea oil deposits should be tapped off the coasts
of Alaska, Florida, and other states along the Atlantic
Coast. Others fear that tapping these oil fields could
damage the environment and businesses such as
tourism that rely on beautiful coastlines.
Water is another resource on which perspectives
can differ. For example, in Florida, fresh water
from Lake Okeechobee has been diverted from the
Everglades to support commercial agriculture. Some
Floridians want to restore the flow of water to the
Everglades to protect its ecosystem, while others
think that supporting agriculture is more important.
Support a Point of View With Evidence
How might environmental protection conflict with
economic development? The United States and the
Global Economy
Globalization poses challenges even for the world’s
most successful economy—our own. For the United
States to compete in global markets, American
workers must be ready to respond to changes in the
workplace. And American companies must continue
their long tradition of innovation.
A Changing Workplace The workplace is not
what it used to be. Manufacturing is still important,
but information now drives the economy of the
United States and the world. Workers need to gain
the technical skills that are necessary to access,
understand, and use all sorts of information.
Education is more important than ever.
The need for education does not end when people
find jobs. Skilled workers must keep up-to-date with
new technology so that they can remain productive
in their current jobs. Others must learn completely
new skills when they find that their existing jobs no
longer pay a good wage—or when jobs are lost due to
offshoring.
Another feature of the changing American
workplace is greater diversity. Generations of African
Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos have made
major contributions to the culture and the economy GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN 1. FACTORY 1 IN CHINA 2. CONTAINER TRAIN 3. CHINESE PORT 4. CONTAINER SHIP 5. U.S. PORT 6. CONTAINER TRAIN 7.

The Pressure to Compete Globalization has made economic competition more intense. Consumers in developing nations are demanding a greater variety of products and services. More countries are competing to meet this growing demand. Competition affects business relationships as well. One firm might have a long relationship with a local supplier. Yet, if a different supplier can offer lower prices or better service, the firm will make a deal with that supplier&ndash;even when that supplier is located on the other side of the world. For all these reasons, American companies need to stay competitive. Business managers face constant pressure to cut costs and increase profits. They must ensure high productivity to avoid wasting money and work. They need to be constantly on the lookout for better ways to respond to customer needs. Only by staying competitive can American companies thrive. The Need to Innovate As in the past, growing competition spurs innovation. The companies that develop new products or processes can quickly gain a large share of the world market. For example, in 1996, two young American entrepreneurs began work on the Internet search engine company that became Google. Ten years later, the company had worldwide sales of $10.6 billion. By 2013, Google&apos;s sales had climbed to around $50 billion. Still, introducing an innovative product and enjoying its success is not the end of the story. Any new good or service can quickly be replaced by a newer one, developed by another entrepreneur hungry to succeed. Writer Thomas Friedman, who has studied globalization, says that the new economic world is like a sprint that competitors must run over and over again. Anyone who wins one race cannot guarantee winning a later one. The only solution is to go back to the starting line and&ndash;with fresh innovations to help&ndash;run as fast as possible, again and again.

In 2006, Janet Yellen delivered this speech on the impact of these links on U.S. monetary policy. At the time, Yellen was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of the member banks of the Federal Reserve System. In 2014, Yellen was named Chair of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve System, a position that puts her in charge of U.S. monetary policy. >> Janet Yellen was named Federal Reserve Chair in 2014, at a time of strong links between the U.S. and global economy. . . . Proponents of the view that globalization has affected U.S. inflation commonly claim that it has resulted in disinflationary pressures [pressures that lower inflation] over the last decade. For example, [former Federal Reserve Chairman] Alan Greenspan made precisely this argument in Congressional testimony last year, citing the massive new “army” of workers that has become available to engage in the world&apos;s markets&ndash;some 100 million plus from the former Soviet bloc, some 750 million from China, and the growing powerhouse of talent that India&apos;s workers represent. Beyond its direct impact on the level of U.S. inflation, proponents of this “new view” contend that globalization has altered the dynamics of inflation . . . In particular, their view is that globalization has weakened the traditional link between domestic resource utilization and inflation: With prices increasingly set in global markets, firms have less room to pass on higher costs . . . ; instead, they have to do what they can to control costs . . . As The Economist recently opined: “This makes a nonsense of traditional economic models of inflation, which virtually ignore globalization….” Some observers go even further, arguing that the slack [of unused labor or capital] that matters to inflation is not domestic slack but global slack. ExPLAIN AN ARgUMENT Consider the effect of supply and demand on price. Why would the addition of millions of new workers in Asia increase global slack and decrease inflation? . . . With respect to monetary policy, I find nothing either in theory or the existing empirical evidence to overturn the conclusion that a country like the United States, operating under a flexible exchange rate regime, can ultimately achieve the inflation target of its choice. . . . Linkages between globalization and inflation . . . The first channel is the most obvious one&ndash; the direct effect of the reductions in the prices of imported goods and services that may be caused by globalization, and which are included in the indices of consumer prices that central banks commonly target. . . . [I]t is also possible that globalization could reduce the sensitivity of domestic wages to changes in domestic labor market slack . . . Suppose, for example, that globalization has enhanced the opportunities for firms to substitute imports for domestic output. . . . Such substitution effectively increases the degree of competition between domestic and foreign workers. 484 TOPIC 10 Trade, Development, and Globalization ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="551"> <text><![CDATA[ In the limit&ndash;when such substitution in effect creates a single global labor market&ndash;it could be that global, not domestic, labor market slack explains changes in U.S. wages and inflation. A distinct but related possibility is that globalization may be undermining the bargaining power of U.S. workers, making them more fearful of job loss, thus lowering wage demands and holding inflation down. . . . CITE EVIdENCE What evidence does Yellen present to support the argument that globalization might keep wages low in the United States? Evidence from import prices . . . The array of evidence . . . suggests that foreign factors have had some impact on U.S. prices&ndash;an impact that may be increasing&ndash;but overall it has been rather limited. Such findings should not come as a great surprise. Despite the growing trend toward integration, the U.S. is far&ndash;very far&ndash;from being fully integrated with the rest of the world&apos;s markets. As I just mentioned, imports still amount to a fairly small fraction of U.S. GDP. In addition, many U.S. goods are not traded, and despite stories about U.S. firms hiring programmers in Bangalore and typesetters in Beijing, they still have to “buy American” when it comes to a host of other services and trades, such as health care, entertainment, and construction. . . . CITE EVIdENCE What evidence does Yellen present to support the argument that globalization has a limited effect on U.S. inflation? Implications for monetary policy Let me now turn to the final portion of my remarks and attempt a response to the question: What implications does globalization have for the Fed&apos;s conduct of monetary policy? My main conclusion is that globalization has no impact on the Fed&apos;s ability to control inflation in the long run. . . However, globalization may have an effect on wage/price dynamics and, as such, may require that monetary policy be recalibrated to take these changes into account, much as was required in the latter half of the 1990s in response to the surge in productivity growth. From the perspective of monetary policy, globalization does matter. . . . Even so, globalization does nothing to imperil the Fed&apos;s ability to attain its inflation objectives. . . . .

    <page pageNumber="552"> <text><![CDATA[ Florida Topic 10 Quick Study Guide LESSON SUMMARIES Use these lesson summaries, and the longer versions available online, to review the key ideas for each lesson in this topic. Lesson 1: Why Nations Trade LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.2.12, SS.912.E.3.2 Nations have different natural resources and different specializations. Absolute advantage is the ability to produce more of a product with a given amount of resources. Comparative advantage is the ability to produce a product more efficiently than other products. Countries specialize in products for which they have comparative advantage. Specialization can lead to job gains in sectors with comparative advantage and job losses in other sectors. Lesson 2: Trade Barriers and Agreements SS.912.E.3.3 Trade barriers, such as tariffs or sanctions, can help domestic producers or safeguard national security, but they mean higher prices for consumers. NAFTA is a trade agreement&ndash;aiming to remove trade barriers and promote free trade&ndash;among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Through regional trade agreements and multinational corporations, economic links among nations have grown. Lesson 3: Exchange Rates and Trade LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.E.3.5 An exchange rate is the value of one currency in terms of another. When exchange rates change, they may boost imports or exports by making them cheaper. If a country imports more than it exports, as the United States does, it has a trade deficit. Countries with more exports than imports have trade surpluses. Lesson 4: Development SS.912.E.3.4, SS.912.E.3.5, SS.912.G.2.2 Development is a process of improving the well-being of a society. Economists use measures such as GDP to gauge development. Developed countries have higher productivity and quality of life than less developed countries. Lesson 5: Growth, Resources, and Development SS.912.G.2.2, SS.912.G.4.4 Rapid population growth, a lack of capital, limited education, poor health, war, political instability, and corruption are obstacles to development. Foreign investment and aid can promote development. International organizations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and nongovernmental organizations also promote development. Lesson 6: Changing Economies LAFS.1112.RH.4.10 Some less developed countries have boosted economic growth by shifting from centrally planned to market economies. This happened in Russia in the late 1900s and early 2000s. China and other Asian countries have also grown economically by promoting exports. Poor education, health issues, and unrest have entrenched poverty in much of Africa, while Latin American countries have seen economic growth. Lesson 7: Globalization LAFS.1112.RH.4.10, SS.912.G.3.3, SS.912.G.4.4 Globalization is the increasing interconnection of producers, consumers, and financial systems worldwide. It has resulted from cheaper communications and the spread of free markets. Globalization may create dangerous links among financial markets and may cause jobs to move from high-wage to low-wage countries. It has highlighted a conflict between development and the environment. Savvas.com/FloridaSS  Go ONLINE for lesson summaries AUDIO READING GAMES ]]></text>

Like earlier trade agreements, such as NAFTA, the TPP lowered trade barriers and provoked controversy. DOCUMENT A The Office of the United States Trade Representative provided this summary of the goals of TPP. [TPP] is a high-standard, ambitious, comprehensive, and balanced agreement that will promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and enhanced labor and environmental protections. We envision conclusion of this agreement, with its new and high standards for trade and investment in the Asia Pacific, as an important step toward our ultimate goal of open trade and regional integration across the region. &ndash;Website of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative DOCUMENT B During seven years of negotiations, the TPP sparked many protests, such as this one. DOCUMENT C Barack Obama, who was President when TPP was signed, explained why he supported it. We&apos;re not going to be able to isolate ourselves from world markets. We got to be in there and compete…. So the Trans-Pacific Partnership … reflects our values in ways that, frankly, some previous trade agreements did not. It&apos;s the highest-standard, most progressive trade deal in history. It&apos;s got strong, enforceable provisions for workers, preventing things like child labor. It&apos;s got strong, enforceable provisions on the environment. . . &ndash;President Barack Obama, remarks at Nike, May 8, 2015 DOCUMENT D Among the U.S. opponents of TPP was Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Let&apos;s be clear: the TPP is much more than a “free trade” agreement. It is part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system. &ndash;Senator Bernie Sanders, “The Trans-Pacific Trade (TPP) Agreement Must Be Defeated,” January 3, 2015 22. Documents A and C support the idea that TPP A. benefits American workers. B. is modeled after previous trade agreements. C. reverses the trend toward growing globalization. D. decreases trade barriers worldwide. 23. The point of view expressed in Document B most closely matches that in A. Document C. B. Document D. C. Documents A and D. D. Documents A and C. 24. Which claim in Document C is directly challenged in Document D? A. The United States cannot isolate itself from world markets. B. Some previous trade agreements did not reflect American values. C. TPP has enforceable provisions that benefit the environment. D. TPP will lead to further job loss through offshoring. 25. Writing Task Write a letter to your senator arguing for a specific decision regarding the TPP. Evaluate the credibility and accuracy of the sources presented here, noting discrepancies among them. Based on this information and what you have learned about trade agreements, suggest ways to solve any problems resulting from the decision you support. Savvas.com/FloridaSS Go ONLINE to practice

    <page pageNumber="558"> <text><![CDATA[ United States Constitution United States Constitution The Preamble states the broad purposes the Constitution is intended to serve&ndash;to establish a government that provides for greater cooperation among the States, ensures justice and peace, provides for defense against foreign enemies, promotes the general well-being of the people, and secures liberty now and in the future. The phrase We the People emphasizes the twin concepts of popular sovereignty and of representative government. Legislative Department Section 1. Legislative power; Congress Congress, the nation&apos;s lawmaking body, is bicameral in form; that is, it is composed of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Framers of the Constitution purposely separated the lawmaking power from the power to enforce the laws (Article II, the Executive Branch) and the power to interpret them (Article III, the Judicial Branch). This system of separation of powers is supplemented by a system of checks and balances; that is, in several provisions the Constitution gives to each of the three branches various powers with which it may restrain the actions of the other two branches. Section 2. House of Representatives Clause 1. Election Electors means voters. Members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years. Each State must permit the same persons to vote for United States representatives as it permits to vote for the members of the larger house of its own legislature. The 17th Amendment (1913) extends this requirement to the qualification of voters for United States senators. Clause 2. Qualifications A member of the House of Representatives must be at least 25 years old, an American citizen for seven years, and a resident of the State he or she represents. In addition, political custom requires that a representative also reside in the district from which he or she is elected. Clause 3. Apportionment The number of representatives each State is entitled to is based on its population, which is counted every 10 years in the census. Congress reapportions the seats among the States after each census. In the Reapportionment Act of 1929, Congress fixed the permanent size of the House at 435 members with each State having at least one representative. Today there is one House seat for approximately every 700,000 persons in the population. The words “three-fifths of all other persons” referred to slaves and reflected the Three-Fifths Compromise reached by the Framers at Philadelphia in 1787; the phrase was made obsolete, was in effect repealed, by the 13th Amend ment in 1865. * The gray words indicate portions of the Constitution altered by subsequent amendments to the document. PREAMBLE We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. Article I. Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. Section 2. 1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. 2. No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty-five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. 3. Representatives and direct Taxes* shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and, until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three. Clause 4. Vacancies The executive authority refers to the governor of a State. If a member leaves office or dies before the expiration of his or her term, the governor is to call a special election to fill the vacancy. 4. When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies. 492 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="559"> <text><![CDATA[ 5. The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. Section 3. 1. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State chosen by the Legislature thereof for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote. 2. Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequences of the first Election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year; of the second Class, at the Expiration of the fourth Year; and of the third Class, at the Expiration of the sixth Year; so that one-third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies. 3. No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen. 4. The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided. 5. The Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States. 6. The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. 7. Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. Clause 5. Officers; impeachment The House elects a Speaker, customarily chosen from the majority party in the House. Impeachment means accusation. The House has the exclusive power to impeach, or accuse, civil officers; the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 6) has the exclusive power to try those impeached by the House. Section 3. Senate Clause 1. Composition, election, term Each State has two senators. Each serves for six years and has one vote. Originally, senators were not elected directly by the people, but by each State&apos;s legislature. The 17th Amendment, added in 1913, provides for the popular election of senators. Clause 2. Classification The senators elected in 1788 were divided into three groups so that the Senate could become a “continuing body.” One-third of the Senate&apos;s seats are up for election every two years. The 17th Amendment provides that a Senate vacancy is to be filled at a special election called by the governor; State law may also permit the governor to appoint a successor to serve until that election is held. Clause 3. Qualifications A senator must be at least 30 years old, a citizen for at least nine years, and must live in the State from which elected. Clause 4. Presiding officer The Vice President presides over the Senate, but may vote only to break a tie. Clause 5. Other officers The Senate chooses its own officers, including a president pro tempore to preside when the Vice President is not there. Clause 6. Impeachment trials The Senate conducts the trials of those officials impeached by the House. The Vice President presides unless the President is on trial, in which case the Chief Justice of the United States does so. A conviction requires the votes of two-thirds of the senators present. No President has ever been convicted. In 1868 the House voted eleven articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson, but the Senate fell one vote short of convicting him. In 1974 President Richard M. Nixon resigned the presidency in the face of almost certain impeachment by the House. The House brought two articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton in late 1998. Neither charge was supported by even a simple majority vote in the Senate, on February 12, 1999. Clause 7. Penalty on conviction The punishment of an official convicted in an impeachment case has always been removal from office. The Senate can also bar a convicted person from ever holding any federal office, but it is not required to do so. A convicted person can also be tried and punished in a regular court for any crime involved in the impeachment case. United States Constitution 493 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="560"> <text><![CDATA[ Section 4. Elections and Meetings Clause 1. Election In 1842 Congress required that representatives be elected from districts within each State with more than one seat in the House. The districts in each State are drawn by that State&apos;s legislature. Seven States now have only one seat in the House: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The 1842 law also directed that representatives be elected in each State on the same day: the Tuesday after the first Monday in November of every even-numbered year. In 1914 Congress also set that same date for the election of senators. Clause 2. Sessions Congress must meet at least once a year. The 20th Amendment (1933) changed the opening date to January 3. Section 5. Legislative Proceedings Clause 1. Admission of members; quorum In 1969 the Supreme Court held that the House cannot exclude any member-elect who satisfies the qualifications set out in Article I, Section 2, Clause 2. A majority in the House (218 members) or Senate (51) constitutes a quorum. In practice, both houses often pro ceed with less than a quorum present. However, any mem ber may raise a point of order (demand a “quorum call”). If a roll call then reveals less than a majority of the members present, that chamber must either adjourn or the sergeant at arms must be ordered to round up absent members. Clause 2. Rules Each house has adopted detailed rules to guide its proceedings. Each house may discipline members for unacceptable conduct; expulsion requires a two-thirds vote. Clause 3. Record Each house must keep and publish a record of its meetings. The Congressional Record is published for every day that either house of Congress is in session, and provides a written record of all that is said and done on the floor of each house each session. Clause 4. Adjournment Once in session, neither house may suspend (recess) its work for more than three days without the approval of the other house. Both houses must always meet in the same location. Section 4. 1. The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of choosing Senators. 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day. Section 5. 1. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties, as each House may provide. 2. Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member. 3. Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. 4. Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting. 494 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="561"> <text><![CDATA[ Section 6. 1. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony, and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place. 2. No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office. Section 7. 1. All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills. 2. Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve, he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of the House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sunday excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment, prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law. 3. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or, being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill. Section 6. Compensation, Immunities, and Disabilities of Members Clause 1. Salaries; immunities Each house sets its members&apos; salaries, paid by the United States; the 27th Amendment (1992) modified this pay-setting power. This provision establishes “legislative immunity.” The purpose of this immunity is to allow members to speak and debate freely in Congress itself. Treason is strictly defined in Article III, Section 3. A felony is any serious crime. A breach of the peace is any indictable offense less than treason or a felony; this exemption from arrest is of little real importance today. Clause 2. Restrictions on office holding No sitting member of either house may be appointed to an office in the executive or in the judicial branch if that position was created or its salary was increased during that member&apos;s current elected term. The second part of this clause&ndash;forbidding any person serving in either the executive or the judicial branch from also serving in Congress&ndash;reinforces the principle of separation of powers. Section 7. Revenue Bills, President&apos;s Veto Clause 1. Revenue bills All bills that raise money must originate in the House. However, the Senate has the power to amend any revenue bill sent to it from the lower house. Clause 2. Enactment of laws; veto Once both houses have passed a bill, it must be sent to the President. The President may (1) sign the bill, thus making it law; (2) veto the bill, whereupon it must be returned to the house in which it originated; or (3) allow the bill to become law without signature, by not acting upon it within 10 days of its receipt from Congress, not counting Sundays. The President has a fourth option at the end of a congressional session: If he does not act on a measure within 10 days, and Congress adjourns during that period, the bill dies; the “pocket veto” has been applied to it. A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote in each house. Clause 3. Other measures This clause refers to joint resolutions, measures Congress often passes to deal with unusual, temporary, or ceremonial matters. A joint resolution passed by Congress and signed by the President has the force of law, just as a bill does. As a matter of custom, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution is not submitted to the President for signature or veto. Concurrent and simple resolutions do not have the force of law and, therefore, are not submitted to the President. United States Constitution 495 ]]></text>

The 18 separate clauses in this section set out 27 of the many expressed powers the Constitution grants to Congress. In this clause Congress is given the power to levy and provide for the collection of various kinds of taxes, in order to finance the operations of the government. All federal taxes must be levied at the same rates throughout the country. Clause 2. Congress has power to borrow money to help finance the government. Federal borrowing is most often done through the sale of bonds on which interest is paid. The Constitution does not limit the amount the government may borrow. Clause 3. This clause, the Commerce Clause, gives Congress the power to regulate both foreign and interstate trade. Much of what Congress does, it does on the basis of its commerce power. Clause 4. Congress has the exclusive power to determine how aliens may become citizens of the United States. Congress may also pass laws relating to bankruptcy. Clause 5. has the power to establish and require the use of uniform gauges of time, distance, weight, volume, area, and the like. Clause 6. Congress has the power to make it a federal crime to falsify the coins, paper money, bonds, stamps, and the like of the United States. Clause 7. Congress has the power to provide for and regulate the transportation and delivery of mail; “post offices” are those buildings and other places where mail is deposited for dispatch; “post roads” include all routes over or upon which mail is carried. Clause 8. Congress has the power to provide for copyrights and patents. A copyright gives an author or composer the exclusive right to control the reproduction, publication, and sale of literary, musical, or other creative work. A patent gives a person the exclusive right to control the manufacture or sale of his or her invention. Clause 9. Congress has the power to create the lower federal courts, all of the several federal courts that function beneath the Supreme Court. Clause 10. Congress has the power to prohibit, as a federal crime: (1) certain acts committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and (2) the commission within the United States of any wrong against any nation with which we are at peace. Section 8. The Congress shall have Power 1. To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States; 2. To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; 3. To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; 4. To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States; 5. To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures; 6. To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States; 7. To establish Post Offices and post Roads; 8. To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing, for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries; 9. To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court; 10. To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of nations; 496 United States Constitution ]]></text>

To raise and support Armies; but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years; 13. To provide and maintain a Navy; 14. To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces; 15. To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; 16. To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; 17. To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dockyards and other needful Buildings;&ndash; And 18. To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof. Section 9. 1. The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person. Clause 11. Only Congress can declare war. However, the President, as commander in chief of the armed forces (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1), can make war without such a formal declaration. Letters of marque and reprisal are commissions authorizing private persons to outfit vessels (privateers) to capture and destroy enemy ships in time of war; they were forbidden in international law by the Declaration of Paris of 1856, and the United States has honored the ban since the Civil War. Clauses 12 and 13. Congress has the power to provide for and maintain the nation&apos;s armed forces. It established the air force as an independent element of the armed forces in 1947, an exercise of its inherent powers in foreign relations and national defense. The two-year limit on spending for the army insures civilian control of the military. Clause 14. Today these rules are set out in three principle statutes: the Uniform Code of Military Justice, passed by Congress in 1950, and the Military Justice Acts of 1958 and 1983. Clauses 15 and 16. In the National Defense Act of 1916, Congress made each State&apos;s militia (volunteer army) a part of the National Guard. Today, Congress and the States cooperate in its maintenance. Ordinarily, each State&apos;s National Guard is under the command of that State&apos;s governor; but Congress has given the President the power to call any or all of those units into federal service when necessary. Clause 17. In 1791 Congress accepted land grants from Maryland and Virginia and established the District of Columbia for the nation&apos;s capital. Assuming Virginia&apos;s grant would never be needed, Congress returned it in 1846. Today, the elected government of the District&apos;s 69 square miles operates under the authority of Congress. Congress also has the power to acquire other lands from the States for various federal purposes. Clause 18. This is the Necessary and Proper Clause, also often called the Elastic Clause. It is the constitutional basis for the many and far-reaching implied powers of the Federal Government. Section 9. Powers Denied to Congress Clause 1. The phrase “such persons” referred to slaves. This provision was part of the Commerce Compromise, one of the bargains struck in the writing of the Constitution. Congress outlawed the slave trade in 1808.

A writ of habeas corpus, the “great writ of liberty,” is a court order directing a sheriff, warden, or other public officer, or a private person, who is detaining another to “produce the body” of the one being held in order that the legality of the detention may be determined by the court. Clause 3. A bill of attainder is a legislative act that inflicts punishment without a judicial trial. See Article I, Section 10, and Article III, Section 3, Clause 2. An ex post facto law is any criminal law that operates retroactively to the disadvantage of the accused. See Article I, Section 10. Clause 4. A capitation tax is literally a “head tax,” a tax levied on each person in the population. A direct tax is one paid directly to the government by the taxpayer&ndash;for example, an income or a property tax; an indirect tax is one paid to another private party who then pays it to the government&ndash;for example, a sales tax. This provision was modified by the 16th Amendment (1913), giving Congress the power to levy “taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.” Clause 5. This provision was a part of the Commerce Compromise made by the Framers in 1787. Congress has the power to tax imported goods, however. Clause 6. All ports within the United States must be treated alike by Congress as it exercises its taxing and commerce powers. Congress cannot tax goods sent by water from one State to another, nor may it give the ports of one State any legal advantage over those of another. Clause 7. This clause gives Congress its vastly important “power of the purse,” a major check on presidential power. Federal money can be spent only in those amounts and for those purposes expressly authorized by an act of Congress. All federal income and spending must be accounted for, regularly and publicly. Clause 8. This provision, preventing the establishment of a nobility, reflects the principle that “all men are created equal.” It was also intended to discourage foreign attempts to bribe or otherwise corrupt officers of the government. Section 10. Powers Denied to the States Clause 1. The States are not sovereign governments and so cannot make agreements or otherwise negotiate with foreign states; the power to conduct foreign relations is an exclusive power of the National Government. The power to coin money is also an exclusive power of the National Government. Several powers forbidden to the National Government are here also forbidden to the States. Clause 2. This provision relates to foreign, not interstate, commerce. Only Congress, not the States, can tax imports; and the States are, like Congress, forbidden the power to tax exports. 2. The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public safety may require it. 3. No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed. 4. No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census of Enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken. 5. No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State. 6. No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear or pay Duties in another. 7. No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time. 8. No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. Section 10. 1. No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility. 2. No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws; and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Control of the Congress. 498 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="565"> <text><![CDATA[ 3. No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay. Article II Section 1. 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected as follows: 2. Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit, under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. 3. The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then, the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representatives from each State having one Vote; a quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall choose from them by Ballot the Vice President. Clause 3. A duty of tonnage is a tax laid on ships according to their cargo capacity. Each State has a constitutional right to provide for and maintain a militia; but no State may keep a standing army or navy. The several restrictions here prevent the States from assuming powers that the Constitution elsewhere grants to the National Government. Executive Department Section 1. President and Vice President Clause 1. Executive power, term This clause gives to the President the very broad “executive power,” the power to enforce the laws and otherwise administer the public policies of the United States. It also sets the length of the presidential (and vice-presidential) term of office; see the 22nd Amendment (1951), which places a limit on presidential (but not vice-presidential) tenure. Clause 2. Electoral college This clause establishes the “electoral college,” although the Constitution does not use that term. It is a body of presidential electors chosen in each State, and it selects the President and Vice President every four years. The number of electors chosen in each State equals the number of senators and representatives that State has in Congress. Clause 3. Election of President and Vice President This clause was replaced by the 12th Amendment in 1804. United States Constitution 499 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="566"> <text><![CDATA[ Clause 4. Date Congress has set the date for the choosing of electors as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November every fourth year, and for the casting of electoral votes as the Monday after the second Wednesday in December of that year. Clause 5. Qualifications The President must have been born a citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for at least 14 years. Clause 6. Vacancy This clause was modified by the 25th Amendment (1967), which provides expressly for the succession of the Vice President, for the filling of a vacancy in the Vice Presidency, and for the determination of presidential inability. Clause 7. Compensation The President now receives a salary of $400,000 and a taxable expense account of $50,000 a year. Those amounts cannot be changed during a presidential term; thus, Congress cannot use the President&apos;s compensation as a bargaining tool to influence executive decisions. The phrase “any other emolument” means, in effect, any valuable gift; it does not mean that the President cannot be provided with such benefits of office as the White House, extensive staff assistance, and much else. Clause 8. Oath of office The Chief Justice of the United States regularly administers this oath or affirmation, but any judicial officer may do so. Thus, Calvin Coolidge was sworn into office in 1923 by his father, a justice of the peace in Vermont. Section 2. President&apos;s Powers and Duties Clause 1. Military, civil powers The President, a civilian, heads the nation&apos;s armed forces, a key element in the Constitution&apos;s insistence on civilian control of the military. The President&apos;s power to “require the opinion, in writing” provides the constitutional basis for the Cabinet. The President&apos;s power to grant reprieves and pardons, the power of clemency, extends only to federal cases. 4. The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States. 5. No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. 6. In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. 7. The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them. 8. Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Section 2. 1. The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. 500 United States Constitution ]]></text>

He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. 3. The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session. Section 3. He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States. Section 4. The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. Article III Section 1. The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. Clause 2. Treaties, appointments The President has the sole power to make treaties; to become effective, a treaty must be approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. In practice, the President can also make executive agreements with foreign governments; these pacts, which are frequently made and usually deal with routine matters, do not require Senate consent. The President appoints the principal officers of the executive branch and all federal judges; the “inferior officers” are those who hold lesser posts. Clause 3. Recess appointments When the Senate is not in session, appointments that require Senate consent can be made by the President on a temporary basis, as “recess appointments.” Recess appointments are valid only to the end of the congressional term in which they are made. Section 3. President&apos;s Powers and Duties The President delivers a State of the Union Message to Congress soon after that body convenes each year. That message is delivered to the nation&apos;s lawmakers and, importantly, to the American people, as well. It is shortly followed by the proposed federal budget and an economic report; and the President may send special messages to Congress at any time. In all of these communications, Congress is urged to take those actions the Chief Executive finds to be in the national interest. The President also has the power: to call special sessions of Congress; to adjourn Congress if its two houses cannot agree for that purpose; to receive the diplomatic representatives of other governments; to insure the proper execution of all federal laws; and to empower federal officers to hold their posts and perform their duties. Section 4. Impeachment The Constitution outlines the impeachment process in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 and in Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7. Judicial Department Section 1. Judicial Power, Courts, Terms of Office The judicial power conferred here is the power of federal courts to hear and decide cases, disputes between the government and individuals and between private persons (parties). The Constitution creates only the Supreme Court of the United States; it gives to Congress the power to establish other, lower federal courts (Article I, Section 8, Clause 9) and to fix the size of the Supreme Court. The words “during good Behaviour” mean, in effect, for life. United States Constitution 501 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="568"> <text><![CDATA[ Section 2. Jurisdiction Clause 1. Cases to be heard This clause sets out the jurisdiction of the federal courts; that is, it identifies those cases that may be tried in those courts. The federal courts can hear and decide&ndash;have jurisdiction over&ndash;a case depending on either the subject matter or the parties involved in that case. The jurisdiction of the federal courts in cases involving States was substantially restricted by the 11th Amendment in 1795. Clause 2. Supreme Court jurisdiction Original jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to hear a case in the first instance, not on appeal from a lower court. Appellate jurisdiction refers to a court&apos;s power to hear a case on appeal from a lower court, from the court in which the case was originally tried. This clause gives the Supreme Court both original and appellate jurisdiction. However, nearly all of the cases the High Court hears are brought to it on appeal from the lower federal courts and the highest State courts. Clause 3. Jury trial in criminal cases A person accused of a federal crime is guaranteed the right to trial by jury in a federal court in the State where the crime was committed; see the 5th and 6th amendments. The right to trial by jury in serious criminal cases in the State courts is guaranteed by the 6th and 14th amendments. Section 3. Treason Clause 1. Definition Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution. The Framers intended the very specific definition here to prevent the loose use of the charge of treason&ndash;for example, against persons who criticize the government. Treason can be committed only in time of war and only by a citizen or a resident alien. Clause 2. Punishment Congress has provided that the punishment that a federal court may impose on a convicted traitor may range from a minimum of five years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine to a maximum of death; no person convicted of treason has ever been executed by the United States. No legal punishment can be imposed on the family or descendants of a convicted traitor. Congress has also made it a crime for any person (in either peace or wartime) to commit espionage or sabotage, to attempt to overthrow the government by force, or to conspire to do any of these things. Section 2. 1. The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;&ndash; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers, and Consuls;&ndash; to all Cases of Admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;&ndash; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;&ndash; to Controversies between two or more States;&ndash; between a State and Citizens of another State;&ndash; between Citizens of different States;&ndash; between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens, or Subjects. 2. In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. 3. The trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Section 3. 1. Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. 2. The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted. 502 United States Constitution ]]></text>

And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. Section 2. 1. The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. 2. A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime. 3. No Person held to Service or Labor in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from Service or Labor, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labor may be due. Section 3. 1. New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. 2. The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence. Relations Among States Section 1. Full Faith and Credit Each State must recognize the validity of the laws, public records, and court decisions of every other State. Section 2. Privileges and Immunities of Citizens Clause 1. Residents of other States In effect, this clause means that no State may discriminate against the residents of other States; that is, a State&apos;s laws cannot draw unreasonable distinctions between its own residents and those of any of the other States. See Section 1 of the 14th Amendment. Clause 2. Extradition The process of returning a fugitive to another State is known as “interstate rendition” or, more commonly, “extradition.” Usually, that process works routinely; some extradition requests are contested how- ever&ndash;especially in cases with racial or political overtones. A governor may refuse to extradite a fugitive; but the federal courts can compel an unwilling governor to obey this constitutional command. Clause 3. Fugitive slaves This clause was nullified by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in 1865. Section 3. New States; Territories Clause 1. New States Only Congress can admit new States to the Union. A new State may not be created by taking territory from an existing State without the consent of that State&apos;s legislature. Congress has admitted 37 States since the original 13 formed the Union. Five States&ndash;Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, Maine, and West Virginia&ndash; were created from parts of existing States. Texas was an independent republic before admission. California was admitted after being ceded to the United States by Mexico. Each of the other 30 States entered the Union only after a period of time as an organized territory of the United States. Clause 2. Territory, property Congress has the power to make laws concerning the territories, other public lands, and all other property of the United States. Section 4. Protection Afforded to States by the Nation The Constitution does not define “a republican form of government,” but the phrase is generally understood to mean a representative government. The Federal Government must also defend each State against attacks from outside its border and, at the request of a State&apos;s legislature or its governor, aid its efforts to put down internal disorders.

    <page pageNumber="570"> <text><![CDATA[ Provisions for Amendment This section provides for the methods by which formal changes can be made in the Constitution. An amendment may be proposed in one of two ways: by a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress, or by a national convention called by Congress at the request of two-thirds of the State legislatures. A proposed amendment may be ratified in one of two ways: by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or by three-fourths of the States in conventions called for that purpose. Congress has the power to determine the method by which a proposed amendment may be ratified. The amendment process cannot be used to deny any State its equal representation in the United States Senate. To this point, 27 amendments have been adopted. To date, all of the amendments except the 21st Amendment were proposed by Congress and ratified by the State legislatures. Only the 21st Amendment was ratified by the convention method. National Debts, Supremacy of National Law, Oath Section 1. Validity of Debts Congress had borrowed large sums of money during the Revolution and later during the Critical Period of the 1780s. This provision, a pledge that the new government would honor those debts, did much to create confidence in that government. Section 2. Supremacy of National Law This section sets out the Supremacy Clause, a specific declaration of the supremacy of federal law over any and all forms of State law. No State, including its local governments, may make or enforce any law that conflicts with any provision in the Constitution, an act of Congress, a treaty, or an order, rule, or regulation properly issued by the President or his subordinates in the executive branch. Section 3. Oaths of Office This provision reinforces the Supremacy Clause; all public officers, at every level in the United States, owe their first allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. No religious qualification can be imposed as a condition for holding any public office. Ratification of Constitution The proposed Constitution was signed by George Washington and 37 of his fellow Framers on September 17, 1787. (George Read of Delaware signed for himself and also for his absent colleague, John Dickinson.) Article V The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate. Article VI Section 1. All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation. Section 2. This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. Section 3. The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. Article VII The ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be suf ficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the same. 504 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="572"> <text><![CDATA[ The first 10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, were each proposed by Congress on September 25, 1789, and ratified by the necessary three-fourths of the States on December 15, 1791. These amendments were originally intended to restrict the National Government&ndash;not the States. However, the Supreme Court has several times held that most of their provisions also apply to the States, through the 14th Amendment&apos;s Due Process Clause. 1st Amendment. Freedom of Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, and Petition The 1st Amendment sets out five basic liberties: The guarantee of freedom of religion is both a protection of religious thought and practice and a command of separation of church and state. The guarantees of freedom of speech and press assure to all persons a right to speak, publish, and otherwise express their views. The guarantees of the rights of assembly and petition protect the right to join with others in public meetings, political parties, interest groups, and other associations to discuss public affairs and influence public policy. None of these rights is guaranteed in absolute terms, however; like all other civil rights guarantees, each of them may be exercised only with regard to the rights of all other persons. 2nd Amendment. Bearing Arms The right of the people to keep and bear arms was insured by the 2nd Amendment. 3rd Amendment. Quartering of Troops This amendment was intended to prevent what had been common British practice in the colonial period; see the Declaration of Independence. This provision is of virtually no importance today. 4th Amendment. Searches and Seizures The basic rule laid down by the 4th Amendment is this: Police officers have no general right to search for or seize evidence or seize (arrest) persons. Except in particular circumstances, they must have a proper warrant (a court order) obtained with probable cause (on reasonable grounds). This guarantee is reinforced by the exclusionary rule, developed by the Supreme Court: Evidence gained as the result of an unlawful search or seizure cannot be used at the court trial of the person from whom it was seized. 5th Amendment. Criminal Proceedings; Due Process; Eminent Domain A person can be tried for a serious federal crime only if he or she has been indicted (charged, accused of that crime) by a grand jury. No one may be subjected to double jeopardy&ndash; that is, tried twice for the same crime. All persons are protected against self-incrimination; no person can be legally compelled to answer any question in any governmental proceeding if that answer could lead to that person&apos;s prosecution. The 5th Amendment&apos;s Due Process Clause prohibits unfair, arbitrary actions by the Federal Government; a like prohibition is set out against the States in the 14th Amendment. Government may take private property for a legitimate public purpose; but when it exercises that power of eminent domain, it must pay a fair price for the property seized. The United States Constitution Amendments 1st Amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 2nd Amendment A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 3rd Amendment. No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor, in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law. 4th Amendment. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 5th Amendment. No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War, or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 506 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="573"> <text><![CDATA[ 6th Amendment In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. 7th Amendment In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. 8th Amendment Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted. 9th Amendment The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 10th Amendment The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. 6th Amendment. Criminal Proceedings A person accused of crime has the right to be tried in court without undue delay and by an impartial jury; see Article III, Section 2, Clause 3. The defendant must be informed of the charge upon which he or she is to be tried, has the right to cross-examine hostile witnesses, and has the right to require the testimony of favorable witnesses. The defendant also has the right to be represented by an attorney at every stage in the criminal process. 7th Amendment. Civil Trials This amendment applies only to civil cases heard in federal courts. A civil case does not involve criminal matters; it is a dispute between private parties or between the government and a private party. The right to trial by jury is guaranteed in any civil case in a federal court if the amount of money involved in that case exceeds $20 (most cases today involve a much larger sum); that right may be waived (relinquished, put aside) if both parties agree to a bench trial (a trial by a judge, without a jury). 8th Amendment. Punishment for Crimes Bail is the sum of money that a person accused of crime may be required to post (deposit with the court) as a guarantee that he or she will appear in court at the proper time. The amount of bail required and/or a fine imposed as punishment must bear a reasonable relationship to the seriousness of the crime involved in the case. The prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment forbids any punishment judged to be too harsh, too severe for the crime for which it is imposed. 9th Amendment. Unenumerated Rights The fact that the Constitution sets out many civil rights guarantees, expressly provides for many protections against government, does not mean that there are not other rights also held by the people. 10th Amendment. Powers Reserved to the States This amendment identifies the area of power that may be exercised by the States. All of those powers the Constitution does not grant to the National Government, and at the same time does not forbid to the States, belong to each of the States, or to the people of each State.

    <page pageNumber="574"> <text><![CDATA[ 11th Amendment. Suits Against States Proposed by Congress March 4, 1794; ratified February 7, 1795, but official announcement of the ratification was delayed until January 8, 1798. This amendment repealed part of Article III, Section 2, Clause 1. No State may be sued in a federal court by a resident of another State or of a foreign country; the Supreme Court has long held that this provision also means that a State cannot be sued in a federal court by a foreign country or, more importantly, even by one of its own residents. 12th Amendment. Election of President and Vice President Proposed by Congress December 9, 1803; ratified June 15, 1804. This amendment replaced Article II, Section 1, Clause 3. Originally, each elector cast two ballots, each for a different person for President. The person with the largest number of electoral votes, provided that number was a majority of the electors, was to become President; the person with the second highest number was to become Vice President. This arrangement produced an electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr in 1800; the House finally chose Jefferson as President in 1801. The 12th Amendment separated the balloting for President and Vice President; each elector now casts one ballot for someone as President and a second ballot for another person as Vice President. Note that the 20th Amendment changed the date set here (March 4) to January 20, and that the 23rd Amendment (1961) provides for electors from the District of Columbia. This amendment also provides that the Vice President must meet the same qualifications as those set out for the President in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5. 13th Amendment. Slavery and Involuntary Servitude Proposed by Congress January 31, 1865; ratified December 6, 1865. This amendment forbids slavery in the United States and in any area under its control. It also forbids other forms of forced labor, except punishments for crime; but some forms of compulsory service are not prohibited&ndash;for example, service on juries or in the armed forces. Section 2 gives to Congress the power to carry out the provisions of Section 1 of this amendment. 11th Amendment The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State. 12th Amendment The Electors shall meet in their respective States and vote by ballot for President and Vice President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;&ndash; The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;&ndash; the person having the greatest Number of votes for President shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such a majority, then, from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice President shall act as President, as in case of death or other constitutional disability of the President. The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice President, shall be the Vice President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two thirds of the whole number of Senators, a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States. 13th Amendment Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 508 United States Constitution ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="575"> <text><![CDATA[ 14th Amendment Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two thirds of each House, remove such disability. Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void. Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. 14th Amendment. Rights of Citizens Proposed by Congress June 13, 1866; ratified July 9, 1868. Section 1 defines citizenship. It provides for the acquisition of United States citizenship by birth or by naturalization. Citizenship at birth is determined according to the principle of jus soli&ndash;“the law of the soil,” where born; naturalization is the legal process by which one acquires a new citizenship at some time after birth. Under certain circumstances, citizenship can also be gained at birth abroad, according to the principle of jus sanguinis&ndash;“the law of the blood,” to whom born. This section also contains two major civil rights provisions: the Due Process Clause forbids a State (and its local governments) to act in any unfair or arbitrary way; the Equal Protection Clause forbids a State (and its local governments) to discriminate against, draw unreasonable distinctions between, persons. Most of the rights set out against the National Government in the first eight amendments have been extended against the States (and their local governments) through Supreme Court decisions involving the 14th Amendment&apos;s Due Process Clause. The first sentence here replaced Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, the Three-Fifths Compromise provision. Essentially, all persons in the United States are counted in each decennial census, the basis for the distribution of House seats. The balance of this section has never been enforced and is generally thought to be obsolete. This section limited the President&apos;s power to pardon those persons who had led the Confederacy during the Civil War. Congress finally removed this disability in 1898. Section 4 also dealt with matters directly related to the Civil War. It reaffirmed the public debt of the United States; but it invalidated, prohibited payment of, any debt contracted by the Confederate States and also prohibited any compensation of former slave owners.

    <page pageNumber="576"> <text><![CDATA[ 15th Amendment. Right to Vote&ndash; Race, Color, Servitude Proposed by Congress February 26, 1869; ratified February 3, 1870. The phrase “previous condition of servitude” refers to slavery. Note that this amendment does not guarantee the right to vote to African Americans, or to anyone else. Instead, it forbids the States from discriminating against any person on the grounds of his “race, color, or previous condition of servitude” in the setting of suffrage qualifications. 16th Amendment. Income Tax Proposed by Congress July 12, 1909; ratified February 3, 1913. This amendment modified two provisions in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, and Section 9, Clause 4. It gives to Congress the power to levy an income tax, a direct tax, without regard to the populations of any of the States. 17th Amendment. Popular Election of Senators Proposed by Congress May 13, 1912; ratified April 8, 1913. This amendment repealed those portions of Article I, Section 3, Clauses 1 and 2 relating to the election of senators. Senators are now elected by the voters in each State. If a vacancy occurs, the governor of the State involved must call an election to fill the seat; the governor may appoint a senator to serve until the next election, if the State&apos;s legislature has authorized that step. 18th Amendment. Prohibition of Intoxicating Liquors Proposed by Congress December 18, 1917; ratified January 16, 1919. This amendment outlawed the making, selling, transporting, importing, or exporting of alcoholic beverages in the United States. It was repealed in its entirety by the 21st Amendment in 1933. 19th Amendment. Equal Suffrage&ndash;Sex Proposed by Congress June 4, 1919; ratified August 18, 1920. No person can be denied the right to vote in any election in the United States on account of his or her sex. 15th Amendment Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 16th Amendment The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. 17th Amendment The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures. When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct. This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution. 18th Amendment. Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited. Section 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years of the date of the submission hereof to the States by Congress. 19th Amendment The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 510 United States Constitution ]]></text>

The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin. Section 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day. Section 3. If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President-elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified. Section 4. The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them. Section 5. Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of October following the ratification of this article. Section 6. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission. 21st Amendment Section 1. The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed. Section 2. The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited. Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress. 20th Amendment. Commencement of Terms; Sessions of Congress; Death or Disqualification of President-Elect Proposed by Congress March 2, 1932; ratified January 23, 1933. The provisions of Sections 1 and 2 relating to Congress modified Article I, Section 4, Clause 2, and those provisions relating to the President, the 12th Amendment. The date on which the President and Vice President now take office was moved from March 4 to January 20. Similarly, the members of Congress now begin their terms on January 3. The 20th Amendment is sometimes called the “Lame Duck Amendment” because it shortened the period of time a member of Congress who was defeated for reelection (a “lame duck”) remains in office. This section deals with certain possibilities that were not covered by the presidential selection provisions of either Article II or the 12th Amendment. To this point, none of these situations has occurred. Note that there is neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect until the electoral votes have been counted by Congress, or, if the electoral college cannot decide the matter, the House has chosen a President or the Senate has chosen a Vice President. Congress has not in fact ever passed such a law. See Section 2 of the 25th Amendment, regarding a vacancy in the vice presidency; that provision could some day have an impact here. Section 5 set the date on which this amendment came into force. Section 6 placed a time limit on the ratification process; note that a similar provision was written into the 18th, 21st, and 22nd amendments. 21st Amendment. Repeal of 18th Amendment Proposed by Congress February 20, 1933; ratified December 5, 1933. This amendment repealed all of the 18th Amendment. Section 2 modifies the scope of the Federal Government&apos;s commerce power set out in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3; it gives to each State the power to regulate the transportation or importation and the distribution or use of intoxicating liquors in ways that would be unconstitutional in the case of any other commodity. The 21st Amendment is the only amendment Congress has thus far submitted to the States for ratification by conventions. United States Constitution 511 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="578"> <text><![CDATA[ 22nd Amendment. Presidential Tenure Proposed by Congress March 21, 1947; ratified February 27, 1951. This amendment modified Article II, Section I, Clause 1. It stipulates that no President may serve more than two elected terms. But a President who has succeeded to the office beyond the midpoint in a term to which another President was originally elected may serve for more than eight years. In any case, however, a President may not serve more than 10 years. Prior to Franklin Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms, no President had served more than two full terms in office. 23rd Amendment. Presidential Electors for the District of Columbia Proposed by Congress June 16, 1960; ratified March 29, 1961. This amendment modified Article II, Section I, Clause 2 and the 12th Amendment. It included the voters of the District of Columbia in the presidential electorate; and provides that the District is to have the same number of electors as the least populous State&ndash;three electors&ndash;but no more than that number. 24th Amendment. Right to Vote in Federal Elections&ndash;Tax Payment Proposed by Congress August 27, 1962; ratified January 23, 1964. This amendment outlawed the payment of any tax as a condition for taking part in the nomination or election of any federal officeholder. 25th Amendment. Presidential Succession, Vice Presidential Vacancy, Presidential Inability Proposed by Congress July 6, 1965; ratified February 10, 1967. Section 1 revised the imprecise provision on presidential succession in Article II, Section 1, Clause 6. It affirmed the precedent set by Vice President John Tyler, who became President on the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841. Section 2 provides for the filling of a vacancy in the office of Vice President. The office had been vacant on 16 occasions and remained unfilled for the rest of each term involved. When Spiro Agnew resigned the office in 1973, President Nixon selected Gerald Ford per this provision; and, when President Nixon resigned in 1974, Gerald Ford became President and chose Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President. 22nd Amendment Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President, when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term. Section 2. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress. 23rd Amendment. Section 1. The District constituting the seat of Government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct: A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment. 24th Amendment. Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax. Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 25th Amendment. Section 1. In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President. Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress. 512 United States Constitution ]]></text>

Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office. 26th Amendment. Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age. Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 27th Amendment. No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened. This section created a procedure for determining if a President is so incapacitated that he cannot perform the powers and duties of his office. Section 4 deals with the circumstance in which a President will not be able to determine the fact of incapacity. To this point, Congress has not established the “such other body” referred to here. This section contains the only typographical error in the Constitution; in its second paragraph, the word “department” should in fact read “departments.” 26th Amendment. Right to Vote&ndash;Age Proposed by Congress March 23, 1971; ratified July 1, 1971. This amendment provides that the minimum age for voting in any election in the United States cannot be more than 18 years. (A State may set a minimum voting age of less than 18, however.) 27th Amendment. Congressional Pay Proposed by Congress September 25, 1789; ratified May 7, 1992. This amendment modified Article I, Section 6, Clause 1. It limits Congress&apos;s power to fix the salaries of its members&ndash; by delaying the effectiveness of any increase in that pay until after the next regular congressional election.

Starting with its preamble, the document spells out all the reasons the people of the United States have the right to break away from Britain. Primary Source The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&apos;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel [force] them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed [gifted] by their Creator with certain unalienable [cannot be taken away] Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence [cautiousness], indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations [unjust uses of power], pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism [rule of absolute power], it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish [give up] the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable [priceless] to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions [closing down], to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions [riots] within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure [term] of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. 514 Primary Sources ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="581"> <text><![CDATA[ He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering [lodging] large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries [soldiers] to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy [dishonesty] scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress [correction of wrongs] in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity [generosity], and we have conjured [begged] them by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity [relation by blood]. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude [justness] of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor. ASSESSMENT 1. Identify Cause and Effect How might the ideas about equality expressed in the Declaration of Independence have influenced later historical movements, such as the abolitionist movement and the women&apos;s suffrage movement? 2. Identify Key Steps in a Process Why was the Declaration of Independence a necessary document for the founding of the new nation? 3. Draw Inferences English philosopher John Locke wrote that government should protect “life, liberty, and estate.” How do you think Locke&apos;s writing influenced ideas about government put forth in the Declaration of Independence? 4.

If you get a higher return, say 7 percent, then by the time you retire in 45 years, you would have $163,688. “Whoa! Slow down! 20 years? Retirement? I&apos;m still living at home! I don&apos;t even own my first car yet! Who do you think you are&ndash;my parents?” If that&apos;s your reaction, you&apos;re not alone. A great many high school students do not think much about their financial future. They also don&apos;t like to get stern lectures from Mom or Dad&ndash;whether it&apos;s about financial planning or about those 5,000 extra text messages that appeared on last month&apos;s cellphone bill. But let&apos;s face it: free room and board doesn&apos;t last forever. And often, it comes to an end soon after you get handed a diploma. At some point in the not-too-distant future, the bills in the mail will be yours. The fact is that responsible financial citizens were not born that way. Even your parents had to learn how to comparison shop, avoid impulse buying, and put money aside that they would much rather spend on fun. Chances are they made mistakes along the way. And they wish you could avoid all the same pitfalls. Take a Checkup Start by taking a good look at your own money habits. Are you a big spender? Moderate saver? Do you save anything at all? The answer is pretty easy to figure out. If you have an unexpected windfall, a bigger than expected birthday check, or an opportunity to earn extra money, what do you do with the money? Save it all? Save half? Look to see what you can buy now? Skip the Fats, Go for the Protein! It comes down to fiscal fitness. Developing a solid, fiscal muscle also involves training or budgeting, short- and long-term goal setting, and most of all, patience. Personal finance, like athletics, requires discipline. << One way to be financially responsible is to look for sales. Comparison shopping can help people find the best deals and work towards meeting a budget. 516 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="583"> <text><![CDATA[ Preparing for a long race often involves delayed gratification. An athlete will sacrifice fast-food because it&apos;s bad for his health, and healthy eating will pay off in the long run. The same is true of investing in your future. It may mean putting off purchases today for financial security sometime later on. That&apos;s easy to say but hard to do, especially if you want to keep up with your peers. You and your dollars are the target of marketers and advertisers. According to a national survey, teenagers are rabid consumers of high-tech products. About 75 percent of U.S. teenagers own a cellphone, 60 percent have an MP3 player, and 43 percent have a car. The Long Race The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. The impulse to get what we want now is far stronger than the motivation to save for something that is months or even years down the road. You may have to trick yourself into saving by promising yourself a reward when you have met certain goals. Obstacles What could slow down your progress? One outstanding speed bump is credit card abuse. You don&apos;t want to join the ranks of those who struggle to pay their credit card balance in full every month. They let matters slide&ndash;failing to balance their checkbooks, check their credit card statements, or keep an eye on bank fees and interest rates. You want to develop the fiscal awareness that will keep you out of trouble. Grow Your Money Despite the difficulty of thinking long-term, 65 percent of teens actually admit that they want to learn how to grow their money. This is good news. Even better, 84 percent of teens have savings, with an average amount of $1,044. Fueling those savings is their attitude that the future is now. Savings could translate into a car and college in the short run and a secure life and retirement in the years to come. With the right attitude, you&apos;re ready for basic training. In no time at all, the following words will be part of your conversation. Budgeting&ndash;how to spend your income in such a way that there&apos;s something left over to invest. Compound- ing&ndash;how saving a little now can translate into big money later on in life. Investing&ndash;why the stock market can be both friend and foe.

The word may conjure up images of driving a junk car or eating canned spaghetti every night. But the reality can be just the opposite. In fact, most millionaires use a budget to manage their money. And most of them started early. Average American Family Budget Housing Transportation Food Insurance and Pensions Other Healthcare Entertainment Apparel Cash Contributions 13% 11% 7% 7% 5% 3%4% 34% 16% SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Expenditures, 2010 << Budgets can vary based on lifestyle and income. Developing a budget that includes all of the categories of spending will help determine how much money to set aside for each category. Spending Awareness Surveys show that almost one half of Americans between the ages of 13 and 18 know how to budget their money. That&apos;s the good news. The bad news is more than half don&apos;t. Which group do you fall into? Take this quick quiz: &bull; How much money did you spend on beverages&ndash;from coffee or water to energy drinks&ndash;last week? &bull; How much money will you spend on gas next week? &bull; How long will it take you to save up for the most expensive thing you&apos;d like to buy? If you answered these questions without much trouble, you&apos;ve already taken the first steps to good money management. If you don&apos;t have a clue, maybe it&apos;s time to think about making a budget. Good Habits Start Early Now here&apos;s another question. Did you ever ask for money to spend on concert tickets&ndash;or a piece of jewelry, or a ski trip&ndash;only to hear “You don&apos;t need it, and we can&apos;t afford it”? Odds are you didn&apos;t think of it as an economics lesson. But according to surveys, students who learned about money management at home scored higher than those who learned about it only in school. 518 Personal Finance ]]></text>

Identify needs Identify needs: bills, car payment, etc. Spend wisely Downsize or eliminate impulse buys such as coffee and soda. Prioritize saving Make saving a priority and a habit. Save weekly Add to your savings weekly, even if just a small amount. Plan for the long-term Identify a long-term want and start saving for it. (You&apos;ll be surprised how fast those fast-food outings diminish when you set your mind on something.) Pay down debt Prioritize and pay down any outstanding debt&ndash;including that $5 you owe your sister. Use cash Use cash for daily spending. Work more During vacations or the summer, pick up some extra hours at work. Spend less Live within your means. Spend less than you make. >> Be budget smart! Follow these tips to stay on track with your spending and saving. Income and Expenses Budgeting is a balancing act between income and expenses. It also means weighing your needs against your wants. To begin creating a budget, follow these steps in order. &bull; Make a list of your earnings per month from all sources. Add these up to calculate your expected monthly income. &bull; For one month, keep a record of everything you spend, from chewing gum to car payments. Collect receipts or write everything in a notebook. Make sure you don&apos;t leave anything out. (And that includes savings!) &bull; At the end of the month, organize your spending into categories such as food, entertainment, and car payments. Total the amount in each category. &bull; On a sheet of paper, list your income and expenses. If your total expenses are less than your total income, you&apos;re doing fine. If not, you need to take a hard look at where your money is going. Needs and Wants Right now, many of your basic needs are probably part of the household budget. Still, some of your personal funds may be going toward needs such as car insurance, lunches, or college savings. So, if you are looking to cut down expenses, you should focus first on the wants. Consider the example of Michelle, a high school senior. She works 20 hours a week at a department store, where she earns $10.00 an hour. Her net income&ndash;that is, her take- home pay after taxes&ndash;is $150. Her monthly necessities include $40 for her cellphone bill, $60 on average for gas, and $65 a month on car insurance. Michelle has already set aside $300 a month for her prom and hopes to have $500 by the time prom rolls around. To stay within her budget, she gives up her daily soda habit, saving almost $30 a month. She and her friends also decide to watch movies at home rather than go out. This trade-off will allow them to rent a limousine to go to their prom. Michelle has planned for a long-term goal and budgeted correctly. She has drawn a fine line between needs and wants. Personal Finance 519 ]]></text>

Try not to rationalize impulse buys. Consider them your sworn budget enemies! Long-Term Rewards Err on the side of thrift and responsibility. Live within your means and try to save a set percentage of your income. Some budget counselors suggest allotting 80 percent for needs, 10 percent for wants, and 10 percent for savings. Do that and you might find yourself with a tidy savings within a few short years. Spend without a plan and you might end up like many Americans: deep in debt. In fact, U.S. consumer debt topped an estimated 11.52 trillion dollars in 2013. About $820 billion, or 7.1 percent of outstanding debt is in some stage of delinquency, or late payment, with $580 billion over 90 days late in payment. The 90-day delinquency rate on credit card balances was 9.5 percent of the total credit card debt in 2013, while 11.5 percent of student loans in 2013 were in 90-day delinquency or in default. Learning to budget now may spare you from being part of this grim statistic later. Checking The Right Bank Banks are everywhere. Often they face each other at busy intersections in a community or are tucked in the corner of a supermarket. Every bank is vying for your business. How do you choose among them? You want to use a bank that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC protects your money and the interest it has earned&ndash;up to the insurance limit&ndash;in the event that your bank fails. For an account held by a single individual, the limit was raised to $250,000 in 2008. Banks are generally considered to be financially sound, but failures do occur. << Banks offer FDIC services. 520 Personal Finance ]]></text>

That was it for choices. The services offered by banks have grown in a similar way to the expansion of TV enter- tainment options. Although banks may look very similar, their services are not one-size- fits-all. The bank that is most convenient for you meets your needs. First, you have to figure out what you want and then figure out where to get it. Checking Accounts One universal need is convenient and safe access to your money. Checking accounts and debit cards have made both readily available. To open a check- ing account you will need identification, such as a birth certificate or a driver&apos;s license and a Social Security number. You will also need money to deposit. Which checking account meets your needs? Basic checking: Best bet for customers who use a checking account to pay some bills and use a debit card for some daily expenses. Drawback: Monthly maintenance fees may apply unless you retain a minimum balance or enroll in direct deposit. Some banks may limit the number of checks you can write each month and charge you a per-item fee if you exceed the limit. Free checking: The operative word here is “free,” meaning a no-strings attached account with no monthly service charges or per-item fees, regardless of the balance or activity. Drawback: These are harder to find and the “free” part may be an introductory offer that expires in six months or a year. Checking with overdraft protection: In effect, if you write checks for more than the balance of your deposits, the bank will honor the check by lending you the money you need, up to a preset limit. Drawback: This service comes with hefty fees. ________________ Use words to write the payment amount. Write the name of the payee. Write the current date. Sign your check. Use numerals to enter the payment amount. Write additional information about the payment or payee, such as a reason or an account number. ________________ Use words to write the payment amount.

Tear a check with any errors into small pieces and write “Void” next to the check number in your check register. 4. NEVER write a check for more than your account balance.Personal Finance 521 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="588"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance The Debit Card Most banks offer you a debit card with a checking account. With a credit card logo, it has the look and feel of a credit card, but there is a major difference. The money you spend is deducted from your checking account balance. Debit cards are also used to withdraw money from ATMs, giving you access to your money 24/7. If you use an ATM from a bank other than your own, you will likely be charged a fee. You could pay $2 to get access to your own $20. Debit cards are convenient, but convenience comes with a price. Direct Deposit Banks and employers encourage people to take advantage of direct deposit. A win-win for you and the environment, the paperless transaction enlists your employer to deposit your paycheck directly into your bank account. An employer may ask for your Social Security number, a voided check containing your bank&apos;s routing number, and your account number. Keeping Track When you open a checking account, you will receive a checkbook that includes sequentially numbered checks and a check register, or a booklet in which you&apos;ll record your account transactions. Every time you write a check, make a deposit, or use an ATM, you should take a few seconds towrite it down. It is also important to hold onto your ATM receipts. They are the only proof that you withdrew $40, not $400. Each month the bank will send you a statement of the activity on your account. If you opt to do your banking online, you can access your statement electronically. Your statement lists deposits, withdrawals, ATM transactions, interest paid, and fees charged. You will get a photocopy of any checks that were cashed during that month. Reconcile your bank statement by comparing the transactions on the bank statement to your own records to make sure they agree. By taking a little time to be a good record keeper, you will make life a lot easier and protect yourself from mistakes and fraud. For more banking tips, check out fdic.gov. Online Banking Once upon a time, people had to go to the bank to deposit money, to transfer money from one account to another, or to withdraw money from an account. They had to write a check or use cash to pay bills. This has become ancient history. The online bank is growing fast in popularity. An online bank can be a virtual extension of a brick-and-mortar bank or can exist solely in cyberspace. As long as a bank is insured by the FDIC, deposits are safe up to $250,000. Online Banking Tips Make sure your computer is protected with the latest versions of antivirus and antispyware software. When banking online, ALWAYS double-check the Web site. When creating a password, avoid the obvious, including first names, birthdays, anniversaries, or Social Security numbers. Change passwords on a routine basis. Make sure all other browser windows are closed during your transaction. Exit a banking site after completing your online transactions and empty your computer&apos;s cache. Use Paypal. If your bank doesn&apos;t offer online bill pay, this online escrow service distributes your money fee-free to registered clients.

Internet banks also offer the environmentally friendly option to stop paper records, allowing you to access your statements, canceled checks, and notices online only. Your can even arrange automatic bill payment. Although you receive a bill in the mail or in your e-mail, the amount you owe is automatically deducted from your bank account on a predetermined date. You save time, postage, and the possibility of missing a payment and incurring late fees. There can be other financial advantages to using online banks. Internet bank fees can be as much as 80 percent less than those charged by traditional banks. They may also offer checking, savings, or money market and CD accounts that yield higher interest rates than those offered by traditional banks. A major benefit to the consumer is the ability to find these good deals by comparison shopping online. In the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, “A penny saved is a penny earned.” By getting in the habit of looking for the lowest interest rates on loans and the highest interest rates on savings, the wise consumer will slowly pull ahead of the pack. Add a little compound interest into the mix and the pace of progress will pick up. >> Depositing checks into a savings or checking account using a mobile device is a beneficial service that many people prefer. Be Responsible Even though you may choose to bank online, every month you will get a statement in the mail from your financial institution. It is your responsibility to check this against your online transactions and report any discrepancies to your bank. Laws regulating an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), a system for transferring money from one bank to another, protect you in the case of fraud. You, however, have to do your part. In order to be protected by the law, you must report any errors in transactions within 60 days of the receipt of your bank statement. No matter how careful banks are not to make errors, no one is perfect. If you use automatic bill pay, it is your responsibility to have sufficient funds in the account to cover the transaction.

If not, alert them to the scam. If you think you can&apos;t be fooled, think again. Phishing techniques can be highly elaborate. Many even set up mirror Web pages intended to look like your financial institution&apos;s Web site to earn your trust. Traditional Banking In the balance, why would anyone still use a brick-andmortar bank? There are a number of reasons that make some consumers reluctant to drop traditional banking altogether. While Internet-only banks receive high marks for convenience, they also can be inconvenient. &bull; To fund an account, you will have to mail in a check, arrange for direct deposit, or make a transfer from another bank. This is not a problem, of course, with banks that also operate a physical branch. &bull; Not having the option of being able to speak with someone face-to-face is another inconvenience. Some customers prefer to interact with people who know them personally. Making a phone call or communicating by e-mail is not to everyone&apos;s liking. &bull; Another drawback is the difficulty of finding fee-free ATMs, although online banks often have ATM networks for their customers to use at minimal cost. << ATM machines are a banking convenience that usually charge a small transaction fee. 524 Personal Finance ]]></text>

More than 80 percent of millionaires are self-made, first-generation rich. But forget the lottery and other get-rich-quick schemes. You have to set your own goals and work toward them. Pay Yourself First In order to get started on your road to wealth, you have to remember one simple rule: Pay yourself first. A good rule of thumb is to set aside 10 to 15 percent of your income. We will talk later about how to achieve this goal, but for the time being, accept the fact. The lifestyle you choose to live now will determine the lifestyle you will be able to have in the future. But, don&apos;t forget others, as well. Charitable giving to organizations working to help the less fortunate are good investments in everyone&apos;s future. Get Help From Interest Let&apos;s assume that you have made the decision to save. The positive news is that your savings will work for you. Banks pay you interest for using your money. Interest rates are expressed as percentages and indicate how much money an account will earn on funds deposited for a full year. Interest is compounded when it is added to your principal and you earn interest on both amounts. In effect, compound interest is interest on interest. Most first-generation millionaires acquire their wealth over a lifetime. Their road to riches has more to do with budgeting, compound interest, and careful investing than with salary and inheritances. Basic Investing Putting money in a savings account is very safe. The only danger to money in a savings account is that the rate of inflation will be greater than the interest rate. Over time, the money in your savings account could lose value&ndash;it will buy less and less. But you will never lose your principal, the amount of money you put in the account. Investing money is not the same as “saving” money. Investors take more risk&ndash;even possibly losing money&ndash;in the hopes of getting a higher return on their money. Investing your money can give your dollars a greater opportunity to grow. Bonds, stocks, and mutual funds are among the many investment choices that you have. Of course, with the possibility of greater growth comes the possibility of greater loss. If you invest in a corporate bond, stock, or mutual fund, you stand the risk of losing some or all of the money you invested. This risk is offset by the possibility of greater gain, allowing your money to grow at a faster rate than the rate of inflation. Personal Finance 525 ]]></text>

When you buy a bond, you are lending money in return for a guaranteed payout at some later date. The safest bonds to buy are government-issued bonds because it is unlikely that a government will go bankrupt. You can get U.S. government bonds through your bank, and they can be bought in small denominations. Many corporate bonds carry a low-to-moderate risk to investors and take anywhere from 5 to 30 years to mature. The value of some bonds varies. For example, if you buy a bond when interest rates are 6 percent but you want to sell it before it matures, then the bond&apos;s value will be affected by current interest rates. If rates have gone up since you bought the bond, then you will have to discount the price to sell it. Why else would anyone want it, if they could get a higher rate of interest elsewhere? But, if interest rates have gone down, then that 6 percent rate will seem much more inviting. In this case, you could sell the bond for more than you paid for it. Because the value of bonds is relatively stable, they are a good investment for people who cannot tolerate much risk. Families saving to send children to college may find bonds attractive because they generally earn higher interest than a savings account and aren&apos;t likely to fall sharply in value the way stocks can. Stock Up Stocks represent ownership in a public company. If you buy shares in a corporation, you become a part owner. You will make money if the price of the stock goes up and if you receive dividends, which are a portion of the profits paid to the owners. There are two kinds of stock, preferred stock and common stock. Preferred stock holders get a set dividend and are paid from the corporate profits before the common stock holders. Stocks are generally a riskier investment than bonds. Historically, however, stocks have rewarded their owners with higher returns than bonds or savings accounts. By knowing about the types of stocks, understanding how returns are generated, and weighing the risk factors, you can assess ways to be a wise investor in the stock market. Stock markets are a reflection of the sum of the buying and selling of all stocks in that market. Investors use what they know about the companies, industries, business in general, and the events happening in the world to make their buying and selling decisions. Investing is tied directly to what is known about the investments. Investors are, however, just people, and people do not always act rationally nor do they always have all the information they need to make a decision. Many investors make poor decisions because they don&apos;t consider their own biases, like being more influenced by losses in the values of their investments than by the gains, or in investing in the familiar, like family businesses or domestic stocks rather than international stocks. To be a smart investor you should learn as much as you can about your investments and learn about human nature to avoid costly mistakes. 526 Personal Finance ]]></text>

By combining your money with that of other investors, the managers of the mutual fund can buy a wide variety of stocks and bonds. When you buy a mutual fund, you are buying a part ownership of the stocks or bonds owned by the investment company. The biggest advantage of investing in this way is that you instantly have a diversified portfolio. Your risk is spread out. Three kinds of mutual funds have three levels of risk. &bull;Money market funds, which are not the same as money market accounts, are short-term, low-risk investments. The money you invest is used to make short- term loans to businesses or governments. &bull;Bond funds are investments in bonds. Though riskier than money market funds, they have a higher potential return. &bull;Stock funds are made up of a variety of stocks. Over the long term, they have provided higher returns than either market funds or bond funds. Mutual fund companies are required by law to register reports and statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You can check up on them through the SEC&apos;s data- base at www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/mutualsearch.htm. Morningstar and Standard and Poors are two companies that rate mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and other investments. Investment Strategy Many first-time investors think that the way to make money is to buy low and sell high. But, trying to time the stock market has proven elusive to even the most savvy investor. When all is said and done, it&apos;s best to use common sense.

    <page pageNumber="594"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance People use dollar cost averaging because they know they can’t predict the market. It
is especially useful for common stocks, which can be very volatile—that is, the price
can swing far above and below the average price. Dollar cost averaging is an attempt
to hedge against the ups and downs of the stock market. It does not guarantee gains or
eliminate all possible losses, but it improves your odds of coming out ahead. The Case for Dollar Cost Averaging MONTH PRICE PER SHARE SHARES YOU BUY January $10 50

secure place to park money. Some people invest in collectibles—fine art, baseball cards,
Civil War memorabilia. If the market remains strong, people who can part with what they
have bought stand to make a lot of money. But, if no one is interested in your stamp collection, you may end up using it for postage.
What you choose depends on the risk you are willing to accept. You also need to consider the length of your investments and any tax burdens the investment may carry. If
your scheme is to count on “sure things” or use tips from the cousin of your neighbor’s

the sale of stocks or property are capital gains. In recent years, the taxes on long-term
capital gains have been lower than the tax rate on the interest from bonds and savings
accounts. As an added bonus, interest earned on U.S. government bonds is exempt from
state and local taxes. What it comes down to in the end is that informed decisions and

    <page pageNumber="596"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance Ricky’s habit of living within his budget month to month does not allow for life changes
and emergencies. On his list of people to pay, Ricky has left someone out. He has forgotten to pay himself.
Get in the Habit What does it mean to pay yourself first? It simply means to make
personal savings a regular part of your budget, just like rent and food. Everyone has the
potential to save, even if it means sacrificing a few immediate wants. You’d be surprised
where the savings can come from. Cut out the daily $2.00 for soft drinks at the vending
machine, and you’ve just saved $14 a week. Multiply that by 52, and you’ve pocketed a
tidy sum in just one year.
Saving is a habit and takes discipline. You can get into the habit of saving money every
month by taking a percentage of your monthly income and then paying yourself first. For
example, you can have your employer automatically deposit a certain amount into your
savings account. But don’t touch it!
People who have trouble saving manage their money in reverse. They spend first, and then
save what is left. But what if there’s nothing left? Then there’s nothing left to save. Saving
doesn’t mean you don’t get to spend your money. It means you get to spend it later.
Why Save? Not many young people think about saving for retirement. (“Retirement? I
haven’t even started working!”) Yet, when it comes to saving, time is money. There are at
least three big benefits to thinking now about the day you finally stop working. The biggest benefit is compound interest.
Tale of Two Savers Amount saved (in dollars) 1,400,000 1,200,000 1,000,000 800,000 600,000 400,000 200,000 Age of Saver 0 18 28 38 48 58 68 << Both savers start with $200 and put away $200 a month. Both earn
8 percent interest compounded annually. Saver 1 starts at age 18. Saver
2 starts at age 36. The difference in the amount they have at retirement
is more than $1 million! 530 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="597"> <text><![CDATA[ The Magic of Compound Interest The earlier you start saving, the faster your money will grow. The reason: compound interest. Compound interest is interest you earn, not only on the money you put into an account, but also on all the interest you have previously built up. Today&apos;s interest earnings will start earning interest tomorrow. The more you save today, the more interest you will gain tomorrow. And that savings will add up at a faster rate. For every year that you put off saving, you could lose thousands of dollars in the long haul. Other Benefits There are also big tax benefits when you stash money away for retirement. If you put funds into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), the money may escape taxation until you retire&ndash;or at least until you reach age 59 1/2. That cuts your tax bill NOW. Even better, when you withdraw your money from a special IRA (called a Roth IRA), the money you make&ndash;the appreciation&ndash;may not be taxed at all. You can also see the value of setting up a savings and investment plan early when you look at the time value of money. If you think about a target value you want for your savings or investments, you&apos;re thinking about that money in future terms, say, $100,000 10 years from now. To understand the value of that $100,000 today, how much you would need to invest now to reach that goal over a specific number of years at a particular interest rate, you have to discount that future value of $100,000 based on the rate of return or interest your investment or savings will make over that period of time. Let&apos;s say you have a goal of having $50,000 saved in 10 years by putting your money into an investment that will have a 5% rate of return over that 10 years. To determine how much money you need to put into that investment today, the present value of that $50,000, you would divide the future value of your money ($50,000) by the sum of 1 plus the rate of return (0.05, which is 5% expressed as a decimal) raised to the number of years of the investment as an exponent&ndash;(1+ rate of return)number of years of investment. For our example, that looks like $50,000 ÷ 1.0510 = $30,695.75. This tells us that the present value of our future $50,000 is $30,695.75&ndash;meaning, if we want to have $50,000 after 10 years of earning a 5% rate of return then today we would have to invest $30,695.75. Finally, putting money away now allows you to have a cushion in case of emergencies. There are even circumstances in which&ndash;despite the government&apos;s restrictions&ndash;you can dip into a retirement fund to pay for other expenses. For example, you can access some retirement accounts to buy your first house or to cover high medical expenses. Whether your dream is a comfortable retirement, a nice home, or foreign travel, you&apos;re going to need a savings plan to make it come true. As you&apos;ll see, there are many options to choose from. But it all starts with developing a saving habit&ndash;with paying yourself first. Three Savers Okay, so you&apos;ve decided to take a portion of your income every week and put it towards your financial future. Your goal is to achieve financial freedom, meet emergencies, and have a comfortable retirement&ndash;maybe even to “get rich.” But not all paths are equal. Different “Plans” Let&apos;s look at three young adults: Amanda, Tyler, and A.J. Each of them is making about the same amount of money. Each of them decides to take $10 per week and dedicate it to their financial future. Amanda takes her $10 and puts it in a shoebox under her bed. Tyler takes his $10 and puts it in a simple savings account paying 3.6 percent interest. A.J. takes his $10 and invests in lottery tickets in the hopes of winning a million dollars.

    <page pageNumber="598"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance Different Results Each of the three keeps this up regularly for 20 years. Each of them would say, “I&apos;m paying myself first.” But see how different the results are: &bull; Amanda has paid herself a total of $10,400. She now has $10,400. &bull; Tyler has paid himself a total of $10,400. He now has $15,392. &bull; A.J. has paid himself a total of $10,400. He now has $0. The fact is, the odds of winning a state lottery are something like one in 18 million. So what sounds better to you? A 100 percent chance of increasing your savings by nearly $5,000 ... or a 99.99999995 percent chance of losing it all? That&apos;s a no-brainer. Tyler&apos;s savings account is also clearly more profitable than Amanda&apos;s shoebox. But even the savings account may not be the best option of all. Park Your Savings In making a personal savings plan, the first question you have to ask yourself is: How much can I save? You&apos;ve seen how putting aside even a small amount can build up as long as you do it regularly. The amount you save per week should be one that you can reasonably commit to for a year. The key to success is that you must do this even if you cannot afford it. Then, pay your other bills as usual. Savings Account Usually, saving starts with setting up a basic savings account carrying no monthly fee. But when choosing a place to park your savings, shop around. Make sure the bank is FDIC insured. Some banks will charge you excessive fees just for the privilege of having your money. Web sites such as bankrate.com show you what interest rate different banks are currently paying for checking accounts. Interest rates for savings and investments can be expressed in different ways that tell you different things. The nominal interest rate tells you how the dollar value of your savings or investment will grow over time. The real interest rate tells you how the purchasing power of your savings or investment will grow over time when factoring in inflation in the economy over the same period of time. CDs Once you start making more money, think about moving some cash into a certificate of deposit, or CD. Like a savings account, a CD is insured and therefore very low- risk. But CDs generally offer higher interest than a savings account. The catch is, once you put your money in, you can&apos;t take it out for a fixed period of time. Depending on the length of the CD, you would have to part company with your money for as little as three months or as long as five years. There are penalty fees for early withdrawal. As with savings accounts, you can compare CD rates online. You might even opt for an online bank that offers even higher interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks. Here are the details for one available CD: &bull; Initial Deposit: $1,000 &bull; Length of CD: 1 year, 6 months (18 months) &bull; Interest Rate: 4% compounded daily &bull; Annual Percentage Yield (APY): 4.081% &bull; Ending Balance: $1,061.83 Money Markets What if you want a higher yield than a regular savings account without tying up your money? You might open a money market account. This is a type of savings account with a high yield that allows you to write checks as long as you maintain a high balance in the account. So which is the best plan? It all depends on how much you can afford to put aside, and whether high yield is more important to you than easy access to your money. 532 Personal Finance ]]></text>

With so much on your mind now, why would you even think about retirement? The answer is simple. You will have to live later with the consequences of your decisions now. Most people on the brink of retirement today will tell you that they wished they had known then what they know now. It is never too early to plan for retirement. The longer you wait to save, the less time your money has to work for you. If you have a job now, you&apos;re already putting some money away for retirement. The government takes money from your paycheck to save for your future in the form of the FICA tax, or Social Security tax. But experts generally agree that Social Security payments alone will not fund a comfortable retirement. How Much Will You Need? How much money will you need in retirement? That depends on mountains of variables&ndash;your health, your lifestyle, where you live. Everybody has different needs. Let&apos;s look at some current, general estimates. Many financial advisers estimate that you will need 70 percent of your pre-retirement income in order to retire comfortably. By comfortably they mean you will be able to keep up your pre-retirement lifestyle. Your needs are lower because you do not have to buy clothes for work or pay for commuting and eating out. You also won&apos;t have to put as much money into your retirement investments. It is time for them to pay you. No one is average, however. Some people spend more money when they first retire because they have more time for travel and entertainment. As they age, they travel less, and those costs go down. But, in many cases the cost of healthcare goes up. Where Does the Money Come From? The first source is Social Security. You might also have a defined pension, a set amount of money paid by your employer based on your wages and length of employment. Defined pensions, however, are disappearing in private industry. The rest of your retirement income depends on you: a 401(k), Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), investments, and savings. Social Security Each year the Social Security Administration sets the minimum amount of earnings you need to have to be entitled to Social Security benefits. You can begin to collect reduced benefits at age 62 and full benefits at age 67 for people born after 1959. As the population ages, the point will come when Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it collects each year in payroll taxes. There is a lively debate in progress about Personal Finance 533 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="600"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance how long Social Security will last and what it will provide in the future. The message here is that you have to prepare to take care of yourself. << Social Security can offer funds to help with expenses for seniors. 401(k) This leads us to the 401(k). You want to pay attention to this retirement plan. The law allows you to set aside a portion of your pay before taxes are withheld. Rent, credit cards, and student loans may limit what you can contribute to your 401(k), but the returns are worth the sacrifice. Some employers match every dollar you save up to three percent of your salary. Others may choose to contribute 50 cents per dollar you save, up to six percent of your salary. Either way, you get an immediate return on your money and you don&apos;t pay taxes on any of it until you withdraw it years later. Employers have come to realize that many people do not have a clue how to invest the money in their 401(k) accounts. More and more employers are providing sources of investment advice to their employees to help them make the most of their money. Other Accounts The federal government also encourages you to save for retirement by providing special tax advantages for other retirement accounts. You can open up a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) at a bank and contribute $5,000 per year. Depending on your income, this money may be tax deductible. You have to be ready to leave this money alone. Tapping an IRA prior to age 59 1/2 will cost you dual penalties. You will forfeit 10 percent of your interest, plus pay taxes on what you have withdrawn as though it were added income. The 10 percent penalty is waived if the money is used for higher education or first-time home ownership. In a ROTH IRA, contributions are taxed prior to investing but withdrawals after age 59 1/2 are tax free, meaning you never pay taxes on the interest or dividends that have accumulated over the years. Roth IRA money may be withdrawn for first-time homeowners or higher education on the condition that the account has been open for 5 years. Early withdrawals will be subject to the 10 percent penalty. Federal regulations regarding these kinds of accounts are subject to change by Congress. In recent years, Congress has raised the savings limits to encourage people to save more for retirement. Examine all investment options available in a personal retirement plan when planning for your financial future. 534 Personal Finance ]]></text>

risk depends on the three C’s Your Credit Report Your credit report is your financial report card. In addition to your
payment history, it includes the details of your bank and credit card accounts. Lenders
can see how much debt you are already carrying. They can also see if you have had any
bankruptcies or judgments against you or if you owe back taxes.
National credit reporting agencies create a FICO score based on your credit history. The
score falls in a range from about 300 to 900. Usually, a score of at least 700 gives you access to reasonable credit. For a fee, you can find out your credit score at MyFico.com.
A bad credit report can sink more than a loan. It also affects your chances of getting
insurance, an apartment, a mortgage—even a job. Like lenders, many landlords and employers check credit histories. They see on-time bill paying as an indication of whether
you will be a responsible tenant or worker. The Fair Credit Reporting Act sets the
terms by which credit information about you can be gathered and used.

Teens and Credit Americans under 21 can have a credit card if a parent or other individual over 21 co-signs the account or if they can prove that they have the income to make
the monthly payments. About one third of all high school students use cards linked to the
account of a parent or relative. Credit card companies eager to issue young people their
first card used to give out freebies such as t-shirts, but reforms in 2009 made this illegal.
Why do they want your business? The answer is simple: teens spend. Each year, consumers between the ages of 12 and 19 spend well over $100 billion of their own and their
parents’ money. Credit card companies want to tap into this spending power.
Credit Traps and Tips So there you are, card in hand and a world of things to buy.
Unless you learn how to use credit responsibly, you could find yourself in a deep hole. You
won’t be there alone. It is estimated a majority of Americans between the ages of 18 and
24 spend nearly 30 percent of their monthly income on debt repayment.
Ideally, you’ll want to pay off your credit card balance in full every month. True, you are
required to make only a small minimum payment. But for every dollar you don’t pay this
month, you’ll pay interest next month. Worse, first-time cardholders without an established
credit rating are often subject to a higher-than-normal annual percentage rate (APR).
What if you pay late or miss a payment entirely? You’ll be subject to a late penalty. The
finance charges, which include the APR and any related fees, can quickly add up to more
than your initial purchase.
Suppose a credit card company requires a $10 minimum payment on a $290 outfit. If your
payment is late by even one day, you’ll get hit with a late fee and more than likely a significantly higher APR. And if your balance goes over the credit limit set by the issuer, there’s
a charge for that, too. Suddenly, the $290 “bargain” can turn into a $600 headache Repayment Schedule on a $2,000 Credit Card Loan

A person paying only $40 a month would incur $1,994 in interest charges by the time the loan was
repaid—paying nearly double the amount of the original debt.
The Cost of Cash Fees mount up even faster if you use your credit card to get cash. A
cash advance carries an up-front fee of 2 percent to 4 percent, plus a higher interest rate
than the regular card. And the charges start the second the ATM coughs out the cash. Personal Finance 537 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="604"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance Read the Fine Print The importance of reading the fine print of a credit card&apos;s terms of agreement should not be lost on any cardholder. The Truth in Lending Act requires banks to provide complete information on the APR, fees, and surcharges. New regulations require credit card companies to tell you how long it will take to pay off your balance if you make only minimum payments. Companies must also notify customers before interest rates increase or terms change. You can opt out of the changes, which will close the account. You can then pay off the balance under the old terms. The time it takes to review these terms could save you headaches and money. Credit or Debit? The surest way to avoid the debt trap is to keep credit card use to a minimum. For lower-cost purchases, you are better off using a debit card, a check, or cash. A debit card offers the same convenience as a credit card. But because the money comes straight out of your bank account, there is no interest rate and no risk of going over your limit. The danger of debit cards is that they are so easy to use, you may lose track of your spending. For online purchases, however, it&apos;s wisest to use a credit card. It offers greater security. Getting Into Debt With today&apos;s world of easy credit, it is not hard to find yourself in debt over your head. Using credit cards or borrowing money is not necessarily bad. You get into trouble when you go overboard. Types of Loans Loans come in several forms. Single-payment loans are short-term loans paid off in one lump sum. Installment loans, such as home mortgages or auto loans, are repaid at regularly scheduled intervals. Each payment is divided between principal, or the amount borrowed, and interest. (The earlier you are in the life of the loan, the higher the proportion of each payment goes toward interest.) A third kind of debt is revolving credit, where the amount borrowed and paid changes each month. The best example is a credit card. There are two general types of loans&ndash;secured and unsecured. A secured loan is one where the borrower puts up some type of collateral, usually a piece of property that can be sold by the lender if the borrower fails to pay back the loan, in order to qualify for the loan. An unsecured loan is one without any collateral. Lenders view secured loans as less risky because they have something they can use to recoup their losses if the borrower fails to repay them. As a result, secured loans tend to have lower interest rates than unsecured loans. Similar to secured loans, lenders also view loans where the borrower has put down a down payment&ndash;a cash payment to the seller of a good that the loan is for&ndash;as less risky and will offer lower interest rates for loans with a down payment. How Much is Too Much? Carrying some debt is not a problem&ndash;almost everybody does it. But you need to stay within safe limits and you need to keep in mind your obligation to repay borrowed money. A general rule is that your debt payments, including 538 Personal Finance ]]></text>

You can estimate your own debt-to-income ratio by dividing the amount of money that you owe by the amount of money that you earn. If the result is higher than 36 percent, you probably owe too much money. Here are some warning signs: &bull; Inability to make minimum payments &bull; Relying on credit cards out of necessity and not convenience &bull; Borrowing from one credit card in order to pay another &bull; Tapping retirement savings or other investments to pay loans Getting Out One reason people take on too much debt is that they want stuff NOW and ignore the fact that credit is a promise to pay later. They don&apos;t adequately plan for the fact that the repayment of principal and interest begins to eat into money needed for necessities. Caught in the Debt Spiral Take Andy. His entry-level job had an entry-level salary. The debt he ran up in college soared as he depended more and more on “plastic” to cover the basics. Paying just the minimum spared his credit temporarily, but he was racking up high finance charges. Once he started missing payments, creditors began calling. Now what? Credit Counseling Andy hated to admit it, but he needed help. He tried credit counseling. A credit counseling agency will negotiate on your behalf with the creditors, trying to get you an extension of time and lower interest rates. For a small service fee, it will take over your monthly payments. Andy checked with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies to find a reputable agency. He now writes one check per month to the agency, instead of three to his creditors. Other Options If you find yourself in Andy&apos;s shoes, there are other options to consider&ndash; with caution. You could swallow your pride and ask a relative or friend for a loan. If you go this route, though, make sure that you have a written repayment plan and offer to pay interest. You could also try taking out a loan from a credit union. Credit unions usually offer more lenient credit terms than banks. You may, however, need a co-signer. Bankruptcy: The Last Resort Bankruptcy is truly your last option. Common reasons for bankruptcy are large hospital and medical bills, uninsured losses, or high credit card bills. Some of these are unavoidable, but many people get into serious debt because of poor decisions and lack of foresight. Once you declare bankruptcy it will be harder for you to obtain credit. Nearly every credit application asks: Have you ever declared bankruptcy? So take this step only with the help of a lawyer who specializes in bankruptcy and can explain the options and consequences. One option is known as Chapter 7, or liquidation. You give up your assets in exchange for your debts. The cash value of your assets is paid to the creditors. To reduce fraud and make it harder to declare bankruptcy, the federal government passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Debtors must prove that their income is below their state&apos;s median income and complete financial counseling and financial management education. Also, the government randomly audits debtors to check up on the accuracy of the bankruptcy documents. Personal Finance 539 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="606"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance A second option is known as Chapter 13, or debt adjustment, which involves temporarily suspending foreclosures and collection actions while you draft and execute a plan to repay some or all of the debts in three to five years. The amount to be repaid depends on how much you have versus how much you owe. Any form of bankruptcy will make it far more difficult to rebuild a secure financial future. Risk Management SS.912.FL.6.2, SS.912.FL.6.3, SS.912.FL.6.4, SS.912.FL.6.5, SS.912.FL.6.6, SS.912.FL.6.7 Insuring the Future You just got ticketed for sailing past a stop sign. You got distracted while you were changing a CD. Your parents are using the word grounded a lot&ndash;and also the word insurance. Sure, they have you covered on their policy, but a moving violation could raise their rates&ndash;and yours&ndash;through the roof. What Is Insurance? The road of life is peppered with the unexpected. Chances are you&apos;ll hit a few bumps along the way. Insurance is part of a risk management plan that will protect you against financial losses. Basically, insurance is a bet between you and your insurer. You are betting that something bad will happen to you, such as illness or a car accident. The company is betting against it. Neither your judgment, nor the insurer&apos;s, is perfectly accurate. Some people tend to underestimate their chances of something bad happening because of a “it can&apos;t happen to me” mindset. Other people tend to overestimate the chances of bad things happening if they have heard of or seen similar things happen to other people recently. Having insurance can also have an unexpected effect on some people&apos;s behavior. Having the security and peace of mind of having insurance can cause some people to engage in riskier behavior than they might if they did not have insurance. Insurers are aware of this and have measures in place to encourage their policyholders to reduce the frequency or size of their claims, measures like deductibles and copayments. Types of Insurance There are four basic types of insurance coverage most adults should have. Your age, family situation, and income are some major factors to consider when deciding the type and amount of coverage you should get. &bull; Auto: Protects you and other drivers in case of an accident that results in damage and injury. It also protects you in case of theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. Most states require you to have your own auto insurance or to be listed as a driver on someone else&apos;s policy. &bull; Health: Protects you in case of illness or injury. It also covers the cost of routine medical and preventive care, prescriptions, and in some cases dental care. Even if you&apos;re healthy, having health insurance is a very good idea. &bull; Property: Protects your home or apartment in case of damage or loss of belongings due to water, fire, or wind. It can cover your liability if someone is injured in your home and sues you for damages. Most policies do not, however, protect against flood damage. You must buy that coverage separately. 540 Personal Finance ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="607"> <text><![CDATA[ &bull; Life: Pays a set amount to your beneficiary in case of your death. The beneficiary is the person or entity, such as a charity, that you name as the recipient of the death benefit of your life insurance policy. The two most common types of life insurance are term, or temporary, insurance and whole life insurance. Rates for term insurance increase over time. The only way to collect from a term policy is to die during the term. Whole life insurance remains in effect for one&apos;s entire lifetime at a set rate. It builds cash value. The insured can borrow against the policy. What It Costs The payment you make to an insurance company is called a premium. The cost of insurance is high and getting higher. So does it pay to buy it? Absolutely. You may never have an accident and file a claim. But if you do, the amount you collect could be many times what you paid in premiums. Even a brief stay in a hospital, for example, can run up a bill of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Besides, in many cases, insurance is not optional. You can&apos;t even register a car without proof of auto insurance. Nor can you get a mortgage without homeowner coverage. Deductibles Insurance companies spread out their risk by collecting premiums from a lot of customers. They also reduce their costs by requiring co-pays and deductibles. A deductible is an amount you have to pay before your coverage kicks in. For example, if your car insurance policy has a $1,000 deductible, and you have an accident, you&apos;ll have to pay the first $1,000 in damages. The company pays the rest. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium. Co-pays If you have a co-pay, you are responsible for a small portion of the total cost of a service covered by your insurance policy. Every time you go to a doctor, you might have to pay a relatively small amount of the bill and your insurance company pays the rest. Generally, you can keep co-pays to a minimum if your medical provider&ndash;a doctor, hospital, or specialist&ndash;is part of your insurance company&apos;s healthcare network. Changing Needs As you get older, acquire more possessions, and expand your family, you have more to replace and more to protect. Coreen at 18–25 Coreen is three months into her first full-time job. Finally eligible for employee health benefits, she lets her parents know that they can remove her from their policy. She also finds an apartment and gets rental insurance to protect her possessions from damage or theft. With no dependents, Coreen leads a relatively carefree existence. She can probably get by with basic auto, rental and health coverage&ndash;for now. Karen and Bill at 25–54 Coreen&apos;s sister Karen and her husband Bill have purchased their first home. They are also expecting their second child. With a new home, children, and two cars, their insurance needs are due for a tune-up. Karen and Bill now need a medical policy that covers more checkups for the children. They also can&apos;t risk having to pay for a new car if they have an accident. With lives and assets to protect, this young family will focus on adding collision insurance to their auto policy and purchasing home, mortgage, and life insurance coverage. Alex and Isabel, Over 54 Coreen&apos;s parents, Isabel and Alex, decide to revisit their insurance needs as well. Free of dependents, they are less concerned about term or whole life insurance coverage. They are far more concerned about the cost of long-term healthcare. Personal Finance 541 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="608"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance Once again, insurance needs change according to age and life circumstances. Because Alex and Isabel are in their 50s, they can expect to pay more for their coverage, perhaps as much as hundreds of dollars a month. Their problem will be trying to find the right coverage at an affordable price. To find the best rates, they will want to get group coverage through an employer or a large organization. Insurance Is an Investment You wind up in the hospital for an emergency appendectomy. Your house is robbed. An uninsured driver hits you from behind. You get to pick up the pieces&ndash;and, unless you&apos;re insured, the bill. It&apos;s All About Risk Insurance is all about avoiding risk. For you, that means paying now to avoid a gigantic cost later. For the insurance company, it means identifying people who are likely to cost them a bundle. Insurers set rates based on risk factors, hard statistics that predict whether someone is likely to be a bad risk. Do you plan to become a pilot or take up mountain climbing? That will make you a higher risk than a lawyer who spends leisure time doing crossword puzzles. A smoker must pay higher health insurance premiums than a nonsmoker. In the worst case, a risky lifestyle may make you uninsurable. You may also be required to purchase different types of insurance by some contracts or by governments. To qualify for a home mortgage, the lender will require you to take out a homeowner&apos;s insurance policy to protect that property in case of a loss to the property. If you live in an area prone to flooding, the government may require you to take out flood insurance before you can buy the home to protect you against property loss in the event of a flood and to protect public agencies from having to support very large numbers of people who might be victims of a flood. Similarly, many states require people to have an auto insurance policy before they can register their vehicle to be driven on public roads. Who&apos;s Got You Covered? Right now, insurance costs are probably not your concern. Most teens are covered for pretty much everything&ndash;life, health, property&ndash;by a parent or guardian. However, some teens must foot their own auto insurance bill. And that&apos;s expensive. Statistically, new drivers are high-risk. But if you want wheels, you have no choice. Health Insurance No matter how healthy your lifestyle is, you are going to face illness or accident. A bout of pneumonia or a broken leg may cost hundreds, even thousands. Even with health insurance, you&apos;ll have to pay something. But it&apos;s better than paying it all. Employer Plans Most young people are covered under parents&apos; health insurance whether they are in school or not&ndash;up to age 26. Once you enter the working world, it&apos;s up to you. If you work for a company that offers health insurance, you can usually choose from a variety of group plans. Some cover you from day one. More often, there is a waiting period. Your share of the premium is deducted from your paycheck each pay period. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium. The least expensive health insurance plan is generally a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). An HMO allows you to pick a primary care physician, to whom you pay a 542 Personal Finance ]]></text>

This is a doctor who has agreed to accept the payment level paid by the insurance company. Get Insured Can&apos;t get insurance through your job or your parents? As of 2014, you can purchase private health insurance from an exchange in your state. The healthcare reform law passed in 2010 also prevents insurance companies from denying you coverage for pre-existing conditions. << Insurance plans help people get the medical care they need, whether it&apos;s a basic check up or special treatment related to an illness or accident. Cut Your Costs The rising number of claims, plus increasing cases of fraud, have caused insurance premiums to skyrocket. But there are a number of steps you can take to get the best coverage for your buck. Comparison shop. Compare the rates of different companies. Check with the local Better Business Bureau. And don&apos;t forget word of mouth. For example, if you&apos;re shopping for auto insurance, talk to people with similar driving records. Don&apos;t just ask about premium costs. Ask about customer service as well. Low price is no bargain if an insurer takes forever to service your claim. Make yourself a better risk. If you smoke&ndash;or collect speeding tickets like they were trading cards&ndash;it&apos;s going to cost you. But insurers also reward behavior that lowers risk. A healthy lifestyle and a good driving record can keep costs in check. And while good grades won&apos;t reduce health or life insurance premiums, they might get you a discount on car insurance. Cover yourself. You and your insurer may not always see eye to eye on a claim. It&apos;s up to you to provide evidence of loss. Take pictures of that busted headlamp. And keep receipts. That way, you&apos;ll be more likely to be covered for everything you&apos;ve paid. Personal Finance 543 ]]></text>

Nowadays, you can often buy insurance online. Still, it might pay for you to use a licensed agent. It all depends on your needs. There are two kinds of insurance agents: captive and independent. Captive agents represent a single insurance company. Independent agents offer policies from many different companies. Both types of agents must be licensed by the state in which they sell. For most purposes, buying directly with a company or its agents works out just fine. But if you are difficult to insure&ndash;for example, if you have a bad driving record&ndash;an independent agent might be the way to go. With access to many different companies, the independent agent can help you find a company that can meet your special needs. A good agent also helps you through the process of filing a claim and acts on your behalf in dealing with the provider. Many agents are also certified to help you with other kinds of financial planning.

There&apos;s that new pair of shoes and the latest video game that you just have to have. Or do you? Before you pull out that credit card, think before you buy. Analyze the costs and benefits of the purchase. The benefits seem obvious. You have something you didn&apos;t have before that you like. The purchase may also be something you absolutely need. But, are the costs worth it? Do you have the cash to pay for it? If you make the purchase, will it keep you from purchasing something that you really need? How will you use what you are purchasing? Will something else already fill that desire or need? What will the purchase do to your future buying power? Can the purchase wait? Another thing to consider is what happens to the purchase after it has exhausted its usefulness? How will you dispose of what you have? Many items, such as electronics, no longer can just be tossed away. Laws protecting the environment govern the disposal of many products. For example, perhaps you purchase the newest cellphone on the market. What happens to the phone when you want to replace it? Will it cost you again to dispose of it? How long do you have to keep it before you dispose of it? Analyzing the costs and benefits of the disposal of personal property, including your responsibility for proper disposal, is always part of a purchase decision. A Major Purchase A major purchase is one that will use up a large chunk of your available cash or credit limit. Buying a home is an example of a major purchase. For most individuals, buying a home means many years of budgeting for repayment of a home loan. Before buying a home, people analyze the costs and benefits of home ownership. 544 Personal Finance ]]></text>

When looking to improve or expand, business owners may make major purchases, such as a building or piece of new equipment. Business owners must analyze the costs and benefits of the purchase and how best it will be used. Likewise, businesses must determine how they might dispose of what was purchased after it no longer is needed. Will the purchase truly benefit the business and help it grow or create greater costs that will hurt business growth? Like most young people, your first major purchase may be a car. Having your own car gives you the freedom to make decisions on where and when you&apos;d like to travel. It also provides a sense of pride in ownership. But, you need to do your homework and spend some time and effort to get a good deal. The Costs of Ownership Step one is to determine what kind of car you can afford to buy and adequately insure and maintain. There are many money issues to consider: &bull; how much you can put down &bull; how much you need to borrow &bull; what your monthly payment will be &bull; how much your insurance premiums will be &bull; how much car maintenance will cost &bull; what gasoline, parking, and tolls will do to your budget Since you have no credit history, you may have to search around for a bank or credit union that will lend you money. To get a vehicle loan, a bank may require you to have a co-signer, a person who is responsible for paying the loan if you default. New or Used If you are going to buy a new car, you want to determine the invoice price of the model you want, and then get at least five competitive bids from dealers. Request bids in writing and then try to negotiate. Will the dealer closest to you match the price of the dealer who is less conveniently located? You can use Web sites such as cars.com, yahoo!autos, and myride.com as online resources for researching and getting bids. Perhaps you have a car you would like to sell before getting another one. This will give you some additional money to use for your new purchase. It also means additional responsibilities to dispose of your personal property.

what if the car you want to sell has some significant mechanical problems?
For example, perhaps the engine of the car cannot be repaired. Rather than sell the entire
car, you decide instead to sell parts of the car. All good. What about the parts of the car
you can’t sell, such as a used battery? How will you properly dispose of the battery? What
do the laws say about where and how you can responsibly dispose of other parts of the
car that cannot be sold? How will the cost of disposal impact the amount of money you
have to purchase another car?
If you’re buying used, get a history of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and
have a mechanic inspect the car. That way you can determine how well the car has been
cared for. There are also online sites that deal with buying used cars. They offer reviews
of online used car classifieds, how to buy a used car from dealers or private sellers, how to
negotiate with tough sellers, scams to avoid, and a list of questions for you to print out to
ask the seller.
New automobiles depreciate, or lose value, quickly. A new car loses half its value in the
first three years. But buying a new car can make sense if you plan to keep the car for a long
time. You have to carry collision insurance if you have a car loan. Used cars are less expensive to buy and insure, but maintenance costs will likely be higher. Budget accordingly Making A Decision Two things will have a major affect on what car you choose: what you like and what you can afford
based on your savings and income. If you are still in school, you will have fewer options than
a well-paid professional has.
To get a taste of what it is like to plan for a major purchase, choose two differently priced cars
from ads in the newspaper or online. Go to a website with a loan calculator, like Bankrate.com,
and estimate how much you would have to pay per month with various down payments, interest
rates, and loan payment plans. How much income would you need in order to buy the car of
your choice? Points to Remember Taxes and fees will be lower on a less expensive car.
• You can lower your monthly payment by putting more money down.
• A lower interest rate will mean you pay less over the life of the loan. >> Put some time and thought into making a decision that best meets your needs based on your available resources.Leasing Leasing is primarily used by businesses or by those who don’t plan on driving
many miles. If you go over the mileage allowed for the term of the auto lease, generally
12,000 miles per year, you have to pay a substantial fee for each additional mile. If you have
a long drive to college or a job, the commute could eat up the mileage limit in no time.
Dealing With Dealers You might want to consider taking a more experienced person
along with you when you buy your first car. It pays to have an ally. People in business

    <page pageNumber="613"> <text><![CDATA[ In many cases, salespeople hold the upper hand when it comes to negotiating car prices. You can take a few steps, however, to level the buying field and avoid being pressured into spending more money than you want or can afford. &bull; Be prepared. Know what you want, and get bids based on the invoice price. &bull; Don&apos;t be talked into unnecessary options. &bull; Don&apos;t ever discuss trade-in until after you&apos;ve settled on a sale price. A dealer might want to consider the trade-in vehicle as a reduction to the sticker price. In fact, any trade-in should have nothing to do with the price of the new car. &bull; Don&apos;t be pushed into a quick decision, no matter what one-day specials are dangled before you. &bull; Get the sale offers in writing. If a dealer is not willing to put all agreements in writing, walk away. Warranties Dealers are required by federal law to post a Buyer&apos;s Guide on the used cars they offer for sale. This guide must specify whether the vehicle is being sold “as is” or with a warranty, and what percentage of the repair costs the dealer will pay. Most new and some used cars come with a manufacturer&apos;s warranty that covers certain repairs for a set period of time or up to a certain mileage limit. Extended warranties increase the amount of time or mileage that repairs will be covered. No warranty covers basic maintenance, like oil changes or new tires. If you do happen to buy a car and the next day the engine falls out, you&apos;re protected by federal and state “lemon laws.” First, however, you should go back to the dealer if you think you&apos;ve bought a lemon. If you cannot reach an agreement, check the law to see what recourse you have. Can I Afford It? You&apos;ve dreamed of this day of living under your roof and by your own rules. Independence. Rent. Bills. Cooking and cleaning. Yes, life is full of both ups and downs. The first reality check is figuring out what you can afford. A general rule of thumb is that your rent and utility payments should not cost more than one week&apos;s take-home pay. How can you figure the average monthly cost of utilities? Ask the landlord or the previous tenant. You will have to plan ahead. Many landlords require that you pay the first and last month&apos;s rent up front. In addition, you may have to pay a security deposit. This money is set aside for repairs of any damage you may do to the apartment beyond normal wear and tear. Finding the Right Place Finding the right apartment or rental home takes more than a little time, effort, and money. It also takes evaluating the costs and benefits of any rental option. The federal government has stepped in to level the playing field. The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 makes it illegal for a landlord to discriminate against a potential tenant because of that person&apos;s race, sex, national origin, or religion.

higher than those in smaller cities or rural areas You can make the rental process easier by defining your needs and wants. Usually to rent
an apartment, you have to make a commitment of at least six months. So while the cheap
one-bedroom with high ceilings and walk-in closets may seem like a steal, the fact that
it’s near the firehouse could make it a case of home, sleepless home.
Online Web sites are a good place to begin your apartment hunting. You can also look for
apartments in the real estate section of a local newspaper. And if you’re hiring a realtor
to search on your behalf, keep in mind that they will charge you a fee based on the rental
price. So do your homework, and make a list of priorities for both what you want and do
not want in your new apartment. What if the ideal apartment is beyond your means?
That might be the time to consider getting a roommate to share the cost.

More often than not, a two-bedroom apartment in many locales is not much more expensive than a one-bedroom place. Plus, you can split the utilities and rent. The sources for finding a roommate are the same as those for finding an apartment&ndash;Web sites like roommates.com, newspaper classifieds, and word of mouth. You want someone who has a compatible lifestyle and who can pay their share of the bills on time. Your search for the right roommate is just as important as your search for the right place to live. Furnishings If you have decided to rent an unfurnished apartment, you will need to be resourceful to avoid major expenses. After you have tapped family and friends, yard sales and thrift shops are potential gold mines. An unfurnished apartment is not only empty, it will probably also be bare, right down to the windows and shower&ndash;not to mention the cupboards. Protect Yourself Learn from others&apos; mistakes. Many apartment complex Web sites are chock-full of comments posted by current or previous tenants. You might even ask a passerby in the parking lot. To protect yourself from being charged for pre-existing conditions, assess and photograph any existing damage before you sign a lease. The Lease You, as tenant or “lessee,” and the property owner, as “landlord” or “lessor,” enter into a contract called the lease or rental agreement. Here are some tips to make it a positive experience. &bull; Be prepared with the documents you will need to provide. These items include proof of income and identity, letters of reference, and a check for any required deposit. &bull; Get the lease in writing! Never take an apartment on the basis of a handshake with the landlord. &bull; If you don&apos;t understand something, don&apos;t sign the lease! << Read the entire lease before signing a lease agreement. Renter&apos;s Insurance Even if you furnish with hand-me-downs or thrift-store treasures, be sure to consider renter&apos;s insurance. Maybe your roommate comes fully loaded with a flat-screen television. Should it disappear, you&apos;d be left footing the bill. The benefits can far outweigh the costs. Rights and Responsibilities This is your money and your home, and you have rights. For example, you have the right to privacy. A landlord or maintenance worker is prohibited from entering your apartment without your permission. Renter&apos;s rights and responsibilities Personal Finance 549 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="616"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance vary according to location, but most states provide a tenant-landlord bill of rights. Check with your local housing or consumer affairs office for specific information. Tenants also have responsibilities, such as paying the rent on time and keeping the apartment clean. There may also be quiet hours, a policy imposed on most apartment dwellers. As always, a tenant&apos;s rights come with certain responsibilities. Home Ownership Some individuals may wish to transition from renting to home ownership. Assess the financial aspects of home ownership before considering the transition. Evaluate the costs and benefits of buying a home. Owning a home usually means having a lot more space and privacy. Home ownership is an investment. You may make a substantial amount of money when you sell your home. Home ownership also means monthly mortgage payments, property insurance, and money spent for upkeep and repair. It can limit your ability to move whenever you&apos;d like, since it can take a while to sell a house. Unexpected loss of income can create difficulties in making monthly mortgage payments with the risk of foreclosure. There is a lot to know before making the transition from renting to home ownership. Ask good questions. Will you be able to make the monthly mortgage payment? How will home ownership impact your ability to change jobs or locations? Do you have the time and financial resources to take care of needed upkeep and repair, such as a new roof or furnace? Will the costs of owning a home outweigh the benefits? Assess all of the financial aspects of making the transition from renting to home ownership. Talk to a professional in real estate and banking. There are different types of home loans available to consumers. Some individuals choose a fixed-rate mortgage. In this type of loan the interest rate stays the same over the life of the mortgage, which could be up to 30 years. Some home buyers opt for a variable rate. In this case the interest rate may change over the life of the loan. A rise in interest rate means a rise in the monthly loan payment. A balloon mortgage usually comes with an initial low interest rate, but the loan balance is due within a short time, perhaps at the end of five years. Some loans only require payment of interest. In this case money is not paid toward the principle. Other loans, such as VA (Veterans Administration) loans, FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loans, or reverse mortgages, are special types of home ownership options available to individuals who qualify. It is good to analyze all options before securing a home or other consumer loan. A Growing Crime An estimated 9 million Americans have their identities stolen every year. Chances are you know someone who has been victimized. You may be a victim yourself&ndash;without even knowing it. It Can Happen Anywhere Question: What do going to the beach . . . taking out the garbage . . . and answering your e-mail have in common? Answer: They can all leave you vulnerable to identity theft. A thief can raid your wallet while you&apos;re splashing in the water. A dumpster diver can retrieve old bank statements. Or an innocent-looking e-mail could be a phishing scam to get your personal info. Most people don&apos;t realize they&apos;ve been victimized until it&apos;s too late. You might not find out until you&apos;re denied a student loan because you&apos;ve missed several car payments&ndash;and you don&apos;t even own a car. 550 Personal Finance ]]></text>

Nearly 30 percent fell into the under-30 age bracket. One reason for this trend could be that younger people tend to spend more time on the Internet, where much identity theft occurs. The Cost of Theft Once they have your ID, thieves can use it to commit a wide variety of fraud, such as obtaining credit cards or even a mortgage in your name. Worse, if the crook who stole your identity gets arrested for any crime, you could get stuck with the criminal record. In too many cases, the burden of proof is on the victim. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, it can take 600 hours to repair the damage. Some victims need up to 10 years to fully clear their records. If your identity is stolen, you could face higher insurance costs, credit card fees, and interest rates for loans&ndash;or may even have trouble finding a job. Prime Target: You So should you be worried? Identity theft topped the list of all complaints filed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2012, with more than 369,000 complaints. About one in every 40 households experienced identity theft of a minor. About 27 percent of child ID theft cases are caused by individuals known to the minor. Child ID theft is difficult to resolve. It is important to always keep information about a child&apos;s identity in a safe place. This includes a child&apos;s Social Security number. Why Me? Why are young people so vulnerable? One reason is that most teens have not established credit records that can be monitored. In addition, studies show that teens&ndash; &bull; are less likely than adults to check their credit card records. &bull; are more likely than adults to frequent the Internet and provide personal information. &bull; take greater risks relative to older age groups. &bull; often have an “it can&apos;t happen to me” attitude. Finally, many Americans do not use their Social Security number until around the age of 15, when they apply for driver permits or first jobs. As a result, identity thefts against them may go unnoticed for years. There have even been babies that were the victims of identity theft! At College Over half of all personal information security breaches take place at universities, experts say. Part of the reason may be that nearly half of all college students have had their grades posted by using a Social Security number. It&apos;s within your rights to tell a college administrator not to post your personal information. Lower Your Risk Although there is no foolproof way to safeguard your identity, there are a number of common-sense steps you can take to protect yourself against fraud. Be alert online. Think twice before sharing personal information. Users on social networking sites like Facebook often post personal statuses, favorite music, addresses, cellphone numbers, and former employers. All of this information could be used to create a credit account or take out a loan in your name. Personal Finance 551 ]]></text>

Online Shopping Tips Check out the reviews written by other buyers. Look for a padlock icon in the browser and “https” for security. Check for endorsements from rating agencies, such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Steer clear of sellers who offer low prices only to squeeze you on shipping costs.

Hate it, and you can warn others as well. E-Buyer Be Aware Along with its unique benefits, online shopping includes some unique challenges. How do you really know if the online retailer you&apos;re dealing with is reputable and your information will be secure? For the most part, you have a higher degree of confidence if there is a brick-and-mortar backup to the online stores. Major retailers devote a lot of resources to ensuring that their customers have a satisfying and secure online shopping experience. That does not mean that you should not deal with online-only vendors. You just need to be sure the sites you use are secure and reputable. Bidding Online Comfortable online? The biggest and best deals often exist beyond the big stores. Two of the most-widely used alternatives are the relatively free classifieds and auction sites, such as eBay. These offer shopping alternatives that come with a different set of rules tailored for the online marketplace. Local appeal can be a major advantage. Online classifieds provide access to backyard buyers and sellers at relatively no cost. Your next entertainment center might very well be three towns or three blocks away. In its attempt to keep you scam- and worry-free, these services encourage buyers to deal locally with folks you can meet in person. The site also includes detailed safety guidelines. On Internet auctions, buyers can quickly and easily comparison shop for just about anything, from used cars and leather bomber jackets to concert tickets and even private jets. In this auction format, shoppers can engage in competitive bidding wars. So how are buyers and sellers protected? Buyers rate the reliability and service provided by sellers and eBay makes these ratings available to you. However, if you win a bid and do not go through with the purchase, you are stuck with a negative rating for the rest of your eBay life. There are also services that make it possible for you to pay an individual seller using your credit card. Fighting Fraud There is a new charge on your credit card bill! But where is the merchandise? You never got it, or even worse, you never ordered it. Many credit card companies will investigate suspected cases of fraud on your behalf, limiting your liability to $50. Also, the Fair Credit Billing Act allows you to withhold payment if you believe that someone has stolen your card number. You also have the option of filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at www.ftc.gov. The FTC offers you advice on how to protect against fraud, identity theft, and questionable business practices. The site guides you step-by-step through the process of filing a consumer complaint.

    <page pageNumber="620"> <text><![CDATA[ Personal Finance average cost of tuition and fees at two-year public colleges increased by 3 percent each year from 2003 to 2013. During the same time period, tuition and fees at four-year institutions increased 4.2 percent each year. The good news is that increases posted for the 2013–2014 tuition year were below the average rate increase for the preceding decade. Choose Carefully If rapidly rising costs continue, in 2020 a four-year public education will cost over $158,510 (in constant dollars) for incoming freshman. This includes tuition, fees, room and board, supplies, transportation, and other personal expenses. By 2025 the projected cost is $212,123. The cost at a private university will be approximately twice that amount. For most students, those are pretty scary numbers.

For example, you may need to have your parents co-sign for a student loan. Federal Government When it comes to government aid, the Department of Education offers three basic loans: Direct Loans, Stafford Loans for parents or students, and the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). For those in financial need, there is the Federal Perkins Loan. These loans have a fixed interest rate and are made available through the college. Students who go on to take teaching jobs in certain areas or who volunteer in the Americorps, Peace Corps, or VISTA programs may be eligible to have their federal loans partially repaid or even canceled. To help qualifying graduates, the government limits loan payments to 10% of their discretionary income. Any person who makes their payment on time will have the balance forgiven after 20 years. Private Sources If money from government loans does not cover all your college expenses, private lending sources could fill the gap. Compared to government loans, regular commercial loans typically have higher interest rates, fees, and credit requirements. Trade organizations and educational institutions also offer lending aid. Check with your guidance counselor to find out more information. Other Sources There are other ways to obtain financial aid without taking out loans. All kinds of students can qualify for financial aid that does not have to be repaid. You need not be valedictorian or an all-state basketball star. Other sources of financial aid include grants, scholarships, and work study. Grants A no-strings-attached grant is a no-brainer to consider when applying for financial aid. Available from the federal government, state governments, and higher education institutions, grants are usually awarded according to financial need and tuition rates. Analyze and compare each grant option to see which one is best for you. There are wide varieties of grants out there. Evaluate grant opportunities before applying for a grant. Some grants may be specific to a particular area of study. Others may be specific to an affiliation with a business, or you may need a history of community work in order to qualify. Don&apos;t forget FAFSA, also known as the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, available at www.fafsa.ed.gov. All students should complete the FAFSA, even if they believe they will not qualify for aid. There is always a chance that family circumstances will change. You need to complete this form if you want to be considered for federal aid, such as the Pell Grant and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant. These grants are given to students with “exceptional financial need.” You will need some basic information in order to complete the FAFSA. This includes your date of birth, income information for yourself and possibly for your parent(s), and basic information on available assets that could be used to pay for college. It&apos;s good to work with someone who is familiar with the FAFSA before completing the application, in order to learn more about the process. Find out more by checking out the U.S. Department of Education Web sites www.federalstudentaid.ed.gov or www.students.gov, your state education agency, or your high school guidance office.

Be- sides aid from the school itself, there are scholarships available from individuals, local community initiatives, and civic groups. Check with local organizations such as the Kiwanis and Lions Clubs. Some companies also offer scholarships to children of their em- ployees. Likewise, you might evaluate scholarship opportunities offered by state govern- ments. Take time to research and evaluate scholarships offered by professional organiza- tions, state governments, individuals, and from the schools you would like to attend. Work-study programs are a win-win situation for the student, college, and community. This type of aid allows students to earn money to offset their educational expenses. Con- tact the schools you are interested in attending. Ask about the types of work-study op- portunities offered by the school. Researching and evaluating work-study and scholarship opportunities will help in determining constructive ways to fund your college education. In addition, investigate nontraditional methods of paying for college or post-secondary education and training, such as becoming a resident assistant who offers tutoring services to younger students. Some individuals set up a special investment fund called Plan 529 for children while they are in their early years. The money can later be used for education. Time spent in comparing and contrasting other sources of funding may lead you to some excellent possibilities to help pay for your college education. Getting a Job You may already have had your first job&ndash;after school, weekends, or summers. But for most of us, finding a full-time, long-term job doesn&apos;t come until after we graduate from high school or college. Your Resumé The first step is to prepare a resumé, a written summary of your education- al and work experience. Think of it as an advertisement to market yourself to an employer. You might be thinking, “That&apos;s fine if I have a lot of experience to list. But this is my first real job.” True, but that doesn&apos;t mean you don&apos;t have qualities that employers are inter- ested in. For example, suppose you worked the same job every summer for three years running. That shows that somebody liked you enough to keep hiring you back. Your service in school clubs or volunteer organizations could indicate qualities such as leader- ship, planning abilities, and a strong work ethic. Academic honors can count for a lot, too. Be sure to organize your resumé in a neat, readable fashion&ndash;no fancy type.

Pick people&ndash;other than family&ndash;who can tell potential employers about your character and work ethic: a former boss, a colleague from an internship, a professor or advisor. Be sure to check with potential choices in advance to be sure they are willing to serve as your reference. Be ready with names, home or business addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers. Know Where to Look So you&apos;re ready to look for a job. Where should you start? Make a list of places that seem most promising. And try to find out something about a company before you apply there. It&apos;s all just part of being prepared. You may want to consider a variety of factors when looking for jobs, including location, transportation to and from the job, how the job might affect your family, what level of certainty there is to the job, how much independence you would have on the job, and how satisfied you would be with the work. Looking for a job that is a good fit for you and your life can go a long way in helping you excel in the workplace. The Interview That very first job interview can be an exciting but nerve-wracking experience. But you can prepare for it. Hold a mock interview with family members or friends. Have them ask you possible questions and then critique your responses and your delivery. Make a Good Impression The minute you step into a potential employer&apos;s office, you are being judged. Don&apos;t blow it before you open your mouth. Posture, eye contact, and a firm handshake go a long way to making a positive impression. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. &ndash;Maxim attributed to 20th century Dutch author William Triesthof Believe it or not, dressing the wrong way can be a deal-breaker. What works on the beach or in a dance club won&apos;t cut it in the office. Even a company that allows “casual” dress on the job doesn&apos;t want to see you in tank tops, cutoffs, or flip-flops. Be safe. Think conservative and professional. Yes, that may mean a suit or a dress. Let them tell you that you don&apos;t have to dress that way&ndash;after you get the job. Turn Off That Cellphone The person interviewing you may have to interrupt to take a phone call. But you do not get the same privilege. Before you step in that office, make sure your cellphone is switched off. Nothing will ruin a good interview faster than a ringing cellphone. Ask the Right Questions Where do you see yourself in five years? Why did you choose your particular college major? Why are you the best candidate for this position? Expect to be peppered with questions. But be equally as prepared to ask them. Questions like these show you&apos;re interested in the job: &bull; What are the company&apos;s goals for the next year or so? &bull; How does this job fit in with the company&apos;s goals? &bull; Describe a typical day here in this department. Steer clear of questions about pay, benefits, hours, and vacation time. All of that will be covered if you are asked back for a second interview. Personal Finance 557 ]]></text>

Attached to your check is a pay stub, also known as an earnings statement, which includes your identification information and the pay period you worked. But there&apos;s a lot more to it than that. Salary and Wages It all begins with your wages or salary. Wages refer to hourly pay and can change based on how much time you worked. Salary is monthly or yearly pay, which is not dependent on the number of hours worked.

If you are paid hourly, it should be equal to the number of hours you worked times your hourly wage. (It will also show if you worked overtime at a higher rate.) If you are on an annual salary, it&apos;s your salary divided by the number of pay periods in the year. Withholdings You will immediately notice that your net pay&ndash;the amount the check is made out for&ndash;is far less than your gross pay. Where did the rest of the money go? Your stub lists all your payroll withholdings, the earnings that come out of your check before you get it. Some of these withholdings are voluntary. For example, if you join a company medical or insurance plan, your share of these benefits comes out of your check. Other withholdings, however, go into taxes to the state and federal government. Federal and State Deductions Most workers have federal and state taxes deducted from their earnings. Your employer is also required to pay the federal government a certain percentage of your earnings. XYZ Corporation100 Corporation Crt.

AAALeave Time Includes vacation hours or sick hours. Many employers will detail how many hours have been used to date, and how many hours are remaining for the calendar year. CC >> Earnings statements show figures such as pay rate, gross pay, net pay, and deductions for insurance and other benefits. This portion of a sample earnings statement shows how gross pay is calculated. Social Security and Medicare Social Security (FICA) and Medicare taxes are based on a percentage of your earnings. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. It is a U.S. payroll tax on employees and employers to fund programs that provide benefits for retirees, the disabled, and children of deceased workers. Medicare provides hospital insurance benefits. The W-4 Form Federal and state taxes are deducted based on an estimate of how much you will owe in yearly taxes. Most workers are required to fill out a W-4 form when they start a new job. It includes guidelines to help you do the calculations needed to estimate how much will be withheld from each paycheck. The W-4 gives you the option of taking certain personal allowances that will lower the amount of tax withheld from your income. For example, you may take an exemption for yourself and your spouse. You also can take an exemption for anyone who is dependent on your income, such as a child. Young people who are not married and have no children will generally claim a single exemption.

too much or too little income tax withheld from your pay.
Taxes and You Welcome to the workforce! You have joined the ranks of taxpayers. But
why do you have to pay taxes anyhow? Governments have expenses. They have to pay
salaries for thousands of employees and provide services for millions of citizens. The biggest source of government revenue is taxes. And you are required by law to pay your share.
Don’t Mess With the IRS Among taxes, the federal income tax is top dog. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), an agency within the Treasury Department, applies federal
income tax laws passed by Congress. The agency generates tax forms and collects taxes.
The IRS will notice if you don’t pay what you owe and impose hefty financial penalties for
any misdeeds.
The federal income tax is a progressive tax, so people with the highest income have
the highest tax rates. The system also includes hundreds of tax breaks for people with
special financial burdens, such as people paying for college or starting a business, as well
as rewards for actions like making a donation to charity.
Other Taxes Most state governments collect income tax, too. In addition, states and local communities levy other kinds of taxes, such as sales tax and property tax. Sales taxes
vary from state to state, but they generally involve paying a fixed percentage on most
items you buy. Essentials of life—such as food and medicine—are generally exempt from
sales tax. Property taxes are based on the value of privately owned homes and land.
Taxes are also collected on income you didn’t work for. If Aunt Bessie leaves you money
in her will, you have to pay an inheritance tax. If you buy stock and you make a lot of
money when you sell it, that’s also taxed. State Sales Tax HIGHEST

As of January 1, 2013 Forms, Forms, Forms Sometime during the “tax season,” which runs from January to
April 15, you need to fill out and file the appropriate tax forms. Filing is the only way to
get a refund, or return of excess taxes paid. But whether you’ve got a refund coming or
not, it’s against the law not to file an income tax return.
The W-2 The most common federal tax form is the W-2, which reports wages paid to
employees and taxes withheld from them. The form also reports FICA taxes to the Social
Security Administration. Employers must complete and send out a W-2 to every employee by January 31. Save these documents! Your W-2’s must be attached to your tax return
when you file. 560 Personal Finance ]]></text>

Federal income tax forms are due to the IRS in April each year. 1040 and Beyond When you file your income tax return, which is due by April 15, you&apos;ll use Form 1040, the Individual Income Tax Return. By filling it out properly, you will learn if you owe more money to the government or if the government owes you money. To make life easier, the government introduced the Form 1040EZ, which is the simplest tax form. Its use is limited to taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000 who take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions, that is, listing them separately. Many unmarried people with no children also qualify to use this form. If you have income other than wages, salaries, and tips, Form 1099 comes into play. It&apos;s a statement you receive from payers of interest income, such as banks and savings institutions, that summarizes your interest income for the year. You may also have deductions from your income that you can claim. A common deduction is charitable donations. Many people enjoy the satisfaction they gain from helping charitable organizations and donate some of their income each year. A portion of those donations is deductible from your income on your federal taxes. Be sure to look closely as any categories of income deduction as they can reduce your tax bill considerably. Don&apos;t Guess&ndash;Get Help! You want to make sure you get all the tax deductions that the IRS allows. Each form has step-by-step instructions, but they might not answer all your questions. Here are some other places to get advice: &bull; The IRS has a user-friendly Web site, with lots of information. It can be found at www.irs.gov. &bull; Call the IRS at (800) 829-1040. You can talk to a tax specialist, or even schedule an appointment for help at IRS service centers. But don&apos;t delay. The closer you get to April 15, the harder it may be to get timely help. &bull; Tax-preparation services and tax accountants will prepare your tax return for a fee. Some will file your return for you. If you prepare your return on paper, you must send it to the IRS Service Center listed in the instruction booklet and at the IRS Web site. There are ways you can prepare and “efile” your return online. Filing in this way will get you a faster tax refund. But you usually will have to pay a fee, especially if you use a tax preparation firm. Personal Finance 561 ]]></text>

What would happen if you tried to put toppings on a pizza before you put down the dough for the crust? When studying history, you need to analyze the information by sequencing significant events, individuals, and time periods in order to understand them. Practice this skill by using the reading on this page. Two Crises for Banking As a result of the many bank failures of the Great Depression, banks were closely regulated from 1933 through the 1960s. The government restricted the interest rates banks could pay depositors and the rates that banks could charge consumers for loans. By the 1970s, bankers were eager for relief from federal regulation. The Savings and Loan Crisis In the late 1970s and 1980s, Congress passed laws to deregulate, or remove some restrictions on, several industries. Unfortunately, this deregulation contributed to a crisis in a class of banks known as Savings and Loans (S&Ls). Government regulation had protected S&Ls from some of the stresses of the marketplace. Thus, they were unprepared for the intense competition they faced after deregulation. [ 1. ] Identify the topic and the main events that relate to the topic. Quickly skim titles and headings to determine the topic of the passage. As you read the passage, write a list of significant events, individuals, or time periods related to the topic. [ 2. ] Note any dates and time words such as “before” and “after” that indicate the chronological order of events. Look through your list of events, individuals, or time periods and write down the date for each. This will give you information to apply absolute chronology by sequencing the events, individuals, or time periods. Remember that some events may have taken place over a number of months or years. Is your date the time when the event started or ended? Make sure to note enough details that you can remember the importance of the information. If no date is given, look for words such as “before” or “after” that can tell you where to place this event, time period, or individual compared to others on your list. This will allow you to apply relative chronology by sequencing the events, individuals, or time periods. [ 3. ] Determine the time range of the events. Place the events in chronological order on a timeline. Look for the earliest and latest events, individuals, or time periods on your list. The span of time between the first and last entries gives you the time range. To apply absolute chronology, sequence the entries by writing the date of the first event on the left side of a piece of paper and the date of the last event on the right side. Draw a line connecting the two events. This will be your timeline. Once you have drawn your timeline, put the events in order by date along the line. Label their dates. To apply relative chronology, sequence the significant individuals, events, or time periods on an undated timeline, in the order that they happened. You now have a clear image of the important events related to this topic. You can organize and interpret information from visuals by analyzing the information and applying absolute or relative chronology to the events. This will help you understand the topic better when you can see how events caused or led to other events. You will also be able to analyze information by developing connections between historical events over time. 562 21st Century Skills ]]></text>

Categorizing helps you see what groups of items have in common. Practice this skill using the chart on this page. What categories are shown on this chart? Copy the chart on a sheet of paper and work with a partner to enter examples pertaining to the United States for each category. Foreign Policy Challenge Economic Challenge [ 1. ] Identify similarities and differences among items you need to understand. You need to pay careful attention and sometimes do research to find the similarities and differences among the facts, topics, or objects that you need to understand. Scientists find groups, or categories, of related animals by analyzing the details of the animals&apos; bodies. For example, insects with similar wings, legs, and mouthparts probably belong in the same category. Gather similar information about all the things you need to understand. For example, if you know the location of one thing, try to find the locations of all the things you are studying. If you have different types of information about your topics, you will not be able to group them easily. [ 2. ] Create a system to group items with common characteristics. Once you have gathered similar kinds of information on the items you need to understand, look for items that share characteristics or features. Create categories based on a feature shared by all of the facts, topics, or objects you need to understand. For example, if you have gathered information on the population and political systems of several countries, you could categorize them by the size of their population or their type of political system. 21st Century Skills 563 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="630"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 3. ] Form the groupings. Put each of the items that you are studying into one of the categories that you have created. If some items do not fit, you may need to make a new category or modify your categories. Label each category for the characteristic shared by its members. Examples of labels for categories might include “Countries with more than 100 million people,” “Countries with fewer than 1 million people,” “Democracies,” or “Dictatorships.” Analyze Cause and Effect When you analyze information by identifying cause-and-effect relationships, you find how one event leads to the next. It is important to find evidence that one event caused another. If one event happened earlier than another, it did not necessarily cause the later event. Understanding causes and effects can help you solve problems. Practice this skill as you study the cause-and-effect chart on this page. Agricultural Causes of the Depression of 1893 Westward migration occurs; farming technology improves. As the number of farms increases, farmers buy more land and equipment on credit. Depression hits Europe and the demand for U.S. exports decreases. Farm prices fall. Farmers increase production to pay bills and prices drop further. Banks foreclose on farms.  [ 1. ] Choose a starting point of observation. When trying to understand a historical event, choose the time of that event. If you are trying to understand a current event, you can work backward from a starting point in the present. [ 2. ] Consider earlier events to try to find connections to your starting point, including any language that signals causes. Put the evidence together to identify true causes. When reading, look for events that come before your starting point. Analyze whether these earlier events caused later events. Identify words that signal cause, such as “reason,” “because,” and “led to.” Analyze the information by developing connections between historical events. Make sure that there is evidence showing that the earlier events caused the later events and did not just happen earlier. 564 21st Century Skills ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="631"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 3. ] Consider later events to try to find connections to your starting point, including any language that signals effects. Put the evidence together to determine true effects. Look for events that come after your starting point. Analyze the information in order to determine whether these later events are effects of earlier events. Identify words that signal effect, such as “led to,” “so,” and “therefore.” Make sure that there is evidence showing that these later events were caused by earlier events and did not just happen later. [ 4. ] Summarize the cause-and-effect relationship and draw conclusions. Once you have identified the cause-and-effect relationships between different events, describe these relationships. Draw a diagram that develops the connections between the two historical events. Draw conclusions about any relationships that you see. Compare and Contrast When you analyze information by comparing and contrasting two or more things, you look for similarities and differences between them. This skill helps you understand the things that you are comparing and contrasting. It is also a skill that you can use in making choices. Practice this skill as you study the Venn diagram comparing socialism and communism. What words would you use to describe how these two economic ideas compare and contrast? COMPARING AND CONTRASTING SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM SOCIALISM &bull; Can include range of economic systems and practices &bull; Allows ownership of some private property &bull; Can be part of democratic system &bull; Even distribution of wealth &bull; Centralized control of economic power COMMUNISM &bull; Requires revolutionary change &bull; Government is authoritarian, not democratic &bull; State ownership of factors of production Savvas.com/FloridaSSView Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 565 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="632"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 1. ] Look for related topics and characteristics that describe them. When you are looking for similarities and differences between two things, it can help to start by identifying relationships between them. What do the two things have in common? If two things have nothing in common, such as a dog and a piece of pie, it will be difficult to find similarities or differences. On the other hand, you can compare and contrast two countries or political systems. Look through the information you have on the things or topics you want to compare and contrast, and identify the characteristics, or features, that describe those things or topics. [ 2. ] Look for words that signal comparison (“both,” “similar to,” “also”) or contrast (“unlike,” “different,” “instead”). Look for words that show comparison, or similarity, and those that show contrast, or difference. Take notes on these similarities and differences. This will make it possible to analyze information more quickly. [ 3. ] Identify similarities and differences in the topics, and draw conclusions about them. Look through your notes and analyze the ways in which your topics are similar and different. Usually, topics have both similarities and differences. Try to find patterns in these similarities and differences. For example, all the similarities between two countries might be related to climate, and all the differences might be related to economics. Draw conclusions based on these patterns. In this example, you might conclude that a country&apos;s economy does not depend on its climate. Identifying similarities and differences by comparing and contrasting two topics lets you draw conclusions that help you analyze both topics as well as other topics like them. Identify Main Ideas and Details You can analyze information in a selection by finding the main idea. A main idea is the most important point in a selection. Identifying the main idea will help you remember details, such as names, dates, and events, which should support the main idea. Practice this skill by reading the paragraph on this page. Find the main idea of this paragraph and the supporting details. During his first hundred days in office, which became known as the Hundred Days, Roosevelt proposed and Congress passed 15 major bills. These measures had three goals: relief, recovery, and reform. Roosevelt wanted to provide relief from the immediate hardships of the depression and achieve a long-term economic recovery. He also instituted reforms to prevent future depressions. [ 1. ] Scan titles, headings, and visuals before reading to see what the selection is about. Often, important ideas are included in titles, headings, and other special text. Special text may be primary sources, words that are highlighted, or ideas listed with bullet points. Also, take a look at visuals and captions. By analyzing these parts of the text, you should quickly get a sense of the main idea of the article. 566 21st Century Skills ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="633"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 2. ] Read the selection and then identify the main point of the selection, the point that the rest of the selection supports: this is the main idea. Read through the selection to identify the main idea. Sometimes, the main idea will be the first or second sentence of one of the first few paragraphs. Sometimes, it will be the last sentence of the first paragraph. Other times, no single sentence will tell you the main idea. You will have to come up with your own sentence answering the question, “What is the main point of this selection?” [ 3. ] Find details or statements within the selection that support or build on the main idea. Once you have identified the main idea, look for details that support the main idea. Many or most of the details should be related to the main idea. If you find that many of the details are not related to what you think is the main idea, you may not have identified the main idea correctly. Identify the main idea that the details in the selection support. Analyze the information in the text by finding the main idea and supporting details. Summarize When you analyze information by summarizing, you restate the main points of a passage in your own words. Using your own words helps you understand the information. Summarizing will help you understand a text and prepare for tests or assignments based on the text. Practice this skill by following the steps to summarize the excerpt on this page. Today, many countries are undergoing economic transition. Some are enjoying rapid growth, while others are changing their entire economic systems. Some places that are experiencing rapid economic change are Russia, China, India, and the countries of Africa and Latin America. For many nations, economic transition has meant moving from central planning to a market-based economy. In a command economy, the government owns and controls the factors of production. By contrast, in a market-based economy, the factors of production are owned and controlled by individuals. One of the first steps, then, in moving to a market economy is to sell or transfer government-owned businesses to individuals. This process is called privatization. [ 1. ] Identify and write down the main point of each paragraph in your own words. You may identify the main idea right at the beginning of each paragraph. In other cases, you will have to figure out the main idea. As you read each paragraph, ask yourself, “What is the point this paragraph makes?” The point the paragraph makes is the main idea. Write this idea down in your own words. Savvas.com/FloridaSSView Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 567 ]]></text>

Once you have written down the main idea for each paragraph, write down the main idea of the passage. Write the main idea in your own words. If you have trouble identifying the main idea of the passage, review the titles and headings in the passage. Often, titles and headings relate to the main idea. Also, the writer may state the main idea in the first paragraph of the passage. The main idea of a passage should answer the question, “What is the point this passage makes?” [ 3. ] Use this general statement as a topic sentence for your summary. Then, write a paragraph tying together the main points of the passage. Leave out unimportant details. Analyze the information in the passage by summarizing. Use the main idea of the passage as a topic sentence for your summary paragraph. Use the main ideas that you identified for each paragraph of the passage to write sentences supporting the main idea of the passage. Leave out details that are not needed to understand the main idea of the passage. Your summary should be in your own words, and it should be much shorter than the original passage. Once your summary is written, review it to make sure that it contains all the main points of the passage. If any are missing, revise your summary to include them. If the summary includes unimportant details, remove them. Generalize One good way to analyze materials about a particular subject is to make generalizations and predictions. What are the patterns and connections that link the different materials? What can you say about the different materials that is true of all them? Practice this skill by reading the following statements. What generalization can you make about the role of the government in the marketplace? &bull; The Federal Trade Commission Act says that advertisements cannot be deceptive. &bull; The Truth-in-Lending Act requires businesses offering loans to disclose certain information to consumers before they sign a loan agreement. &bull; The Federal Reserve System regulates banking and manages money supply. &bull; The Food and Drug Administration sets standards for food, drugs, and cosmetics. [ 1. ] Make a list. Listing all of the specific details and facts about a subject will help you find patterns and connections. [ 2. ] Generate a statement. From your list of facts and specific details, decide what most of the items listed have in common. Analyze your information by making generalizations and predictions. [ 3. ] Ensure your generalization is logical and well supported by facts. Generalizations can be valid or invalid. A generalization that is not logical or supported by facts is invalid. 568 21st Century Skills ]]></text>

Predictions are educated guesses about the future, based on clues you find in written material and information you already have. When you analyze information by making generalizations and predictions, you are thinking critically about the material you read. Practice this skill by analyzing the chart below and predicting the effect an economic downturn, with lower corporate and individual earnings, would have on government receipts. Federal Receipts, 2014 (Estimated) 3% 6%46% 11% 34% SOURCE: Office of Management and Budget Individual income taxes Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and other retirement receipts Corporate income taxes Excise Taxes Customs, estate, gift, and other taxes [ 1. ] Review the content. Read your material carefully and research any terms or concepts that are new to you. It&apos;s important to understand the material before analyzing the information to make a prediction. [ 2. ] Look for clues. Gathering evidence is an important part of making predictions. Look for important words, statements, and evidence that seem to support the writer&apos;s point of view. Ask questions about what you are reading, including who, what, where, when, why, and how. Look for and analyze clues to help you generalize and predict. [ 3. ] Consider what you already know. Use related prior knowledge and/or connect to your own experiences to help you make an informed prediction. If you have experience with the subject matter, you have a much better chance of making an accurate prediction. [ 4. ] Generate a list of predictions. After studying the content, list the clues you&apos;ve found. Then use these clues, plus your prior knowledge, to form your predictions. List as many possible outcomes as you can based on clues in the material and the questions you have considered. 21st Century Skills 569 ]]></text>

To make a determination about the author&apos;s message, you analyze information by drawing inferences and conclusions. You consider details and descriptions included in the text, compare and contrast the text to prior knowledge you have about the subject, and then form a conclusion about the author&apos;s intent. Practice this skill by analyzing the document below and drawing inferences about the author&apos;s view of the Soviet economy under communism in 1931. The fear of being exiled [banished, sent away] as a kulak [a landowner] has been a powerful factor in drawing workers into the collective farms. In the Stalin kolkhoz [collective farm] where I stayed, a sharp-eyed dark-haired peasant approached me in the Village Soviet hut. We were in the presence of the Communist president. He spoke to me of the successes of the kolkhoz, of the enthusiasm for the collective farm movement, and of the affection of the peasants for their young Bolshevist leader. Next morning, however, when far away from any of the Communist members of the kolkhoz, the same peasant . . . approached me and whispered, “It is terrible here in the kolkhoz. We cannot speak or we shall be sent away to Siberia. . . . We are afraid. I had three cows. They took them away and now I only get a crust of bread. It is a thousand times worse now than before the Revolution. . . . We have to keep quiet. &ndash;“The Real Russia: The Peasant on the Farm,” Gareth Jones, The Times, October 14, 1931 [ 1. ] Study the image or text. Consider all of the details and descriptions included. What is the author trying to tell you? Look for context clues that hint at the topic and subject matter. [ 2. ] Make a connection. Use related prior knowledge to connect to the text or image. Analyze information by asking questions such as who, what, where, when, and how. Look for cause-and-effect relationships; compare and contrast. This strategy will help you think beyond the available surface details to understand what the author is suggesting or implying. [ 3. ] Form a conclusion. When you draw an inference, you combine your own ideas with evidence and details you found within the text or image to form a new conclusion. This action leads you to a new understanding of the material. Draw Conclusions When you analyze information by drawing inferences and conclusions, you connect the ideas in a text with what you already know in order to understand a topic better. Using this skill, you can “fill in the blanks” to see the implications or larger meaning of the information in a text. Practice this skill by reading the excerpt. What conclusions can you draw based on the information in the paragraph? 570 21st Century Skills ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="637"> <text><![CDATA[ Challenging Economic Times From the Oval Office, Hoover worked hard to end the depression. But to many out-of-work Americans, the President became a symbol of failure. Some people blamed capitalism, while others questioned the responsiveness of democracy. Many believed the American system was due for an overhaul. Although some questioned the ability of America&apos;s capitalistic and democratic institutions to overcome the crisis, most Americans never lost faith in their country. [ 1. ] Identify the topic, main idea, and supporting details. Before reading, look at the titles and headings within a reading. This should give you a good idea of the topic, or the general subject, of a text. After reading, identify the main idea. The main idea falls within the topic and answers the question, “What is the main point of this text?” Find the details that the author presents to support the main idea. [ 2. ] Use what you know to make a judgment about the information. Think about what you know about this topic or a similar topic. For example, you may read that the English settlers of Jamestown suffered from starvation because many of them were not farmers and did not know how to grow food. Analyzing the information about their situation and what you know about people, you could draw the conclusion that these settlers must have had little idea, or the wrong idea, about the conditions that they would find in America. [ 3. ] Check and adjust your judgment until you can draw a well-supported conclusion. Look for details within the reading that support your judgment. Reading a little further, you find that these settlers thought that they would become rich after discovering gold or silver, or through trading with Native Americans for furs. You can use this information to support your conclusion that the settlers were mistaken about the conditions that they would find in America. By analyzing the information further, you might infer that the settlers had inaccurate information about America. To support your conclusions, you could look for reliable sources on what these settlers knew before they left England. Interpret Sources Outlines and reports are good sources of information. In order to interpret these sources, though, you&apos;ll need to identify the type of document you&apos;re reading, identify the main idea, organize the details of information, and evaluate the source for point of view and bias. Practice this skill by finding a newspaper or online report on U.S. unemployment. What steps will you take to interpret this report? [ 1. ] Identify the type of document. Is the document a primary or secondary source? Determine when, where, and why it was written. 21st Century Skills 571 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="638"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 2. ] Examine the source to identify the main idea. After identifying the main idea, identify details or sections of text that support the main idea. If the source is an outline or report, identify the topic and subtopics; review the supporting details under each subtopic. Organize the information from the outline or report and think about how it connects back to the overall topic listed at the top of the outline or report. [ 3. ] Evaluate the source for point of view and bias. Primary sources often have a strong point of view or bias; it is important to analyze primary sources critically to determine their validity. Evaluating each source will help you interpret the information they contain. Create Databases Databases are organized collections of information which can be analyzed and interpreted. You decide on a topic, organize data, use a spreadsheet, and then pose questions which will help you to analyze and interpret your data. Practice this skill by creating a database of features for five different smartphones. Analyze your database to decide which one would best meet your needs. [ 1. ] Decide on a topic. Identify the information that you will convert into a table. This information may come from various sources, including textbooks, refer ence works, and Internet sites. [ 2. ] Organize the data. Study the information and decide what to include in your table. Only include data that is pertinent and available. Based on the data you choose, organize your information. Identify how many columns there will be and what the column headings will be. Decide the order in which you are going to list the data in the rows. [ 3. ] Use a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is a computer software tool that allows you to organize data so that it can be analyzed. Spreadsheets allow you to make calculations as well as input data. Use a spreadsheet to help you create summaries of your data. For instance, you can compute the sum, average, minimum, and maximum values of the data. Use the graphing features of your spreadsheet program to show the data visually. [ 4. ] Analyze the data. Once all of your data is entered and you have made any calculations you need, you are ready to pose questions to analyze and interpret your data. Organize the information from the database and use it to form conclusions. Be sure to draw conclusions that can be supported by the data available.

Does the data in the chart or graph help you answer questions you have about the topic or see any causes or effects? For example, you could use your mathematical skills to create circle graphs or bar graphs that visually organize the data in a different way that allows you to interpret the data differently. [ 5. ] Use the data or information in charts and graphs to understand an issue or make decisions. Use your social studies skills to make inferences, draw conclusions, and take a stand on the issue. Create Charts and Maps MAFS.K12.MP.1.1 Thematic charts, graphs, and maps are visual tools for representing information. When you create a thematic chart, graph, or map you will start by selecting the type of data you want to represent. Then you will find appropriate data to include, organize your data, and then create symbols and a key to help others understand your chart, graph, or map. Practice this skill by creating an economic activity map of your state. Use computer software to generate the state outline, then apply appropriate symbols to represent the major industries of the state. [ 1. ] To create a chart or map, first select a region or set of data. Use a map to represent data pertaining to a specific region or location; use a chart to represent trends reflected in a set of data. [ 2. ] Research and find the data you would like to present in the chart or map. Your choice of data will be based on the theme you wish to explore. For example, a chart or map that explores the theme of changing demographics in Texas might include data about the location of different ethnic groups in Texas in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. [ 3. ] Organize the data according to the specific format of your chart or map. [ 4. ] Create symbols, a key (as needed), and a title. Create symbols to represent each piece of data you would like to highlight. Keep each symbol simple and easy to understand. After you have created the symbols, place them in a key. Add a title to your map or chart that summarizes the information presented. Your symbols and key will make it easier for others to interpret your charts and maps. Analyze Political Cartoons Political cartoons are visual commentaries about events or people. As you learn to analyze political cartoons, you will learn to identify bias in cartoons and interpret their meaning.

A map&apos;s title can help you to identify the region covered by the map. The title may also tell you the type of information you will find on the map. If the map has no title, you can identify the region by reading the labels on the map. [ 2. ] Use the compass rose to determine direction. Although on most maps north is at the top of the map, you should always double check the compass rose. Often, on the compass rose, the first letter of each direction represents that direction. For example, “N” represents the direction “north.” Some compass roses are as simple as an arrow pointing north. [ 3. ] Use the scale to estimate the distance between places. Use appropriate mathematical skills to interpret social studies information such as a map scale. The scale on a map shows how a measurement on the map compares to the distance on the ground. For example, if one inch on the map represents a mile, the number of inches between two places on the map is the distance in miles. [ 4. ] Use the key or legend on a map to find information about colors or symbols on a map. A key or legend often appears in a small box near the edge of the map. The legend will tell you the meaning of colors, symbols, or other patterns on the map. [ 5. ] Use the latitude and longitude grid to determine absolute locations. An absolute location is an exact description of a location on Earth&apos;s surface based on latitude and longitude. You can use the latitude and longitude lines on a map to find the absolute location of a place. Analyze Primary and Secondary Sources Primary sources are firsthand accounts of events. By contrast, secondary sources are secondhand accounts of events. Both sources are useful, but it is important to differentiate between valid primary and secondary sources. In this lesson, you&apos;ll learn how to locate and use primary and secondary sources to acquire information about the United States.

    <page pageNumber="648"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 1. ] Determine who created the source as well as when and why it was created. Determine whether it is a primary or secondary source. Identify the author of the document. Next, look for the date the document was written or the date when the document was first published. Most primary sources are written close to the date of the events described. Secondary sources are often written well after the events described. Firsthand observers or participants in an event create primary sources. People who did not witness an event create secondary sources. Primary sources record an event. Secondary sources analyze or draw conclusions about events. Secondary sources rely on both primary and secondary sources. Good research requires you to analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments from a primary or secondary source for frame of reference. [ 2. ] Identify the central idea and key details, and determine whether they are facts or opinions. Read the text carefully and ask yourself, “What overall point is this text making?” This point is the main idea. Then reread the text and cite specific details that support this main idea. What insights do these details give you into the text as a whole? In a sentence or two, summarize the relationships among key details and ideas. Decide whether key details are facts or opinions. Facts can usually be confirmed in other sources. Opinions are often characterized by emotional language that shows feelings. [ 3. ] Decide whether the source&apos;s information is biased or if it is accurate and credible. Check statements in the text against reliable sources, such as encyclopedias or books written by experts on the topic. If reliable sources agree with the text, it is probably fairly accurate. If most of the text seems to be opinions rather than facts, it is not an accurate source of information. Still, these opinions can teach you about the author&apos;s world. A writer who observed an exciting or scary event may use emotional language to describe the event, but the source may still be a reliable account. An important part of research is analyzing and evaluating the validity of the information, arguments, and counterarguments from primary and secondary sources for bias or propaganda. Compare Viewpoints When people disagree about a topic, they have different viewpoints. Knowing how to analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments from both primary and secondary sources for point of view can help you to learn more about a topic. Practice this skill by reading the following quotes and comparing the viewpoints. “A college degree is worth it. College graduates make an average of 84 percent more over the course of a lifetime than those who only attend high school. The unemployment rate for young college grads is under 5 percent compared to more than 13 percent for those with only a high school diploma.” –Julie Margetta Morgan, Policy Analyst with the Postsecondary Education Program at the Center for American Progress 582 21st Century Skills ]]></text>

About 40 percent do not make it through a four-year bachelor&apos;s degree program in even six years. Others who major in subjects with low vocational demands often have trouble getting jobs.” –Richard Vedder, Director of Center for College Affordability and Productivity [ 1. ] Identify the authors of texts presenting different points of view and identify each author&apos;s frame of reference. Frame of reference is a term that describes the experiences, values, and ideas that influence a person&apos;s opinions and actions. It can also be referred to as point of view. First, identify the group or individual that wrote each text. Determine if the source is primary or secondary. As you read, take note of any information about the author&apos;s experiences or background. Also, look for any signs of what the author thinks is important. These types of statements can help you analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments from both primary and secondary sources for point of view. [ 2. ] Recognize any similarities and differences between the authors&apos; frames of reference and identify the opinion of each author. Pay attention to any similarities and differences between the two authors&apos; experiences, values, and ideas. Read carefully to identify the opinion of each author. In an article about a rock band, an author who played guitar in a band for ten years argues that Band A is the best band today because of its great guitarist. In a second article, another author who sang for many years argues that Band B is the best because of its lead singer. Notice how authors&apos; arguments and counterarguments are shaped by their frame of reference, or point of view. [ 3. ] Draw conclusions about similarities and differences between authors&apos; points of view. With some information about the point of view of each author, you can understand why they have different opinions. This helps you to analyze and evaluate the validity of the information, arguments, and counterarguments. In the example of the two authors writing about rock bands, each author stresses his or her own areas of expertise. You might decide to listen to the band recommended by the singer if you share an interest in vocals. If you are more interested in instrumentals, you might choose the band recommended by the guitarist. Identify Bias LAFS.1112.SL.1.3 Being able to analyze and evaluate the validity of information, arguments, and counterarguments for bias helps you to determine whether primary or secondary sources you find online, in books, or in the media are reliable. When you are able to identify bias in written, oral, and visual material, you can see when someone is presenting only one side of an issue or basing an argument on emotion instead of facts. Practice this skill whenever you read or hear a politician describing an economic policy. Savvas.com/FloridaSS View Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 583 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="650"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 1. ] Identify the author of a source and the author&apos;s purpose. First, identify the author of the source. The author may be a group or an organization rather than a single person. The author may state his or her purpose very clearly in the source. If not, the type of source may give you an idea of the purpose. For example, the writer of an encyclopedia aims to summarize information about a subject. The author of a political Web site may want you to vote for a candidate. [ 2. ] Identify the main idea, and check whether the main idea is supported with facts or opinions. Read the document carefully and ask yourself, “What is the main point of this selection?” Your answer to this question is the main idea. Reread the document and list details that support this main idea. Decide whether these details are facts or opinions. To find out whether they are facts, check whether other reliable sources include the same information. If your source uses statements that shows feelings, those statements are probably opinions. [ 3. ] Look for the use of emotional language or one-sided opinions. Look for words that can show opinions such as “good” and “bad.” Be aware of statements that make you feel angry, scared, or excited. Also, watch out for statements that only express one side of an issue. These are all signs of bias. [ 4. ] Draw conclusions about the author&apos;s bias, if any. Is the author using mostly emotional language with few facts to support his or her ideas? Are there insults or other very negative language in the source? If so, the source is probably biased. Similarly, if you notice that the author is presenting only one side of an issue, the source is probably not reliable. It is important to analyze and evaluate the information, arguments, and counterarguments in both primary and secondary sources for bias. Evaluate Existing Arguments LAFS.1112.RH.3.8 When you evaluate existing arguments, you must evaluate and analyze the point of view and biases of your sources and their authors. Who is the author and what is he or she trying to accomplish? How valid are the arguments in your primary and secondary sources? If you master these skills, you will be able to analyze and interpret social studies information such as speeches. Practice this skill as you read and evaluate the this excerpt. . . . Independence for the Gold Coast was my aim. It was a colony, and I have always regarded colonialism as the policy by which a foreign power binds territories to herself by political ties with the primary object of promoting her own economic advantage. . . . I saw that the whole solution to [our] problem lay in political freedom for our people, for it is only when a people are politically free that other races can give them the respect that is due to them. . . .

    <page pageNumber="651"> <text><![CDATA[ Once this freedom is gained, a greater task comes into view. All dependent territories are backward in education, in science, in agriculture, and in industry. The economic independence that should follow and maintain political independence demands every effort from the people, a total mobilization of brain and manpower resources. What other countries have taken three hundred years or more to achieve, a once dependent territory must try to accomplish in a generation if it is to survive. . . . &ndash;Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana: The Autobiography of Kwame Nkrumah, 1957 [ 1. ] Identify the claim or thesis. What is the author or source claiming? The claim or thesis is usually found in the introduction and/or conclusion of a written or spoken argument. [ 2. ] Identify the reasons (claims to truth or facts) the author offers in support of his or her claim. What evidence does the author or source provide to support their claims? Make a list of the evidence provided to support each claim. [ 3. ] Evaluate the argument. Analyze and evaluate the validity of the evidence presented to support each claim. Use the appropriate skills to analyze and interpret social studies information, such as speeches. Research each claim to be sure that the author&apos;s statements are accurate. Carefully check for evidence of bias or propaganda. Be sure you understand the author&apos;s point of view and his or her frame of reference. Finally, check to be sure that the author&apos;s conclusions follow logically from the evidence presented. If the evidence is accurate, the author is free from bias, and conclusions follow logically from the evidence, the claims are probably valid. Consider and Counter Opposing Arguments LAFS.1112.WHST.1.1 Before you can effectively counter opposing arguments, you&apos;ll need to analyze possible counterarguments for frame of reference, bias, point of view, and propaganda. You&apos;ll plan your response ahead of time, collecting research and data. Then, you&apos;ll make a point of acknowledging the opposing view before presenting your counterarguments. To practice this skill, suppose you are preparing for a debate about raising the minimum wage in your state. Choose a side of the debate to support. What arguments will you use to support your side of the debate? What counterarguments will you anticipate the other side using? Why is it useful to anticipate the other side&apos;s arguments? [ 1. ] Fully understand your argument and the potential counter points. Do research as needed to find out more about other opposing views. Analyze and evaluate the validity of possible counterarguments from primary and secondary sources for frame of reference, bias, point of view, and propaganda. [ 2. ] Make predictions and outline a response to several of the opposing views. Continue researching as needed. Researching, analyzing, and evaluating the validity of opposing arguments will help you support and strengthen your own. Opposing arguments can consist of any reasons, conclusions, or claims that oppose yours. Outline your response to each opposing reason, conclusion, or claim. 21st Century Skills 585 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="652"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 3. ] To counter an opposing argument, first acknowledge the opposing view. This strategy shows that you have heard the opposing argument and are responding accordingly. Consider using statements such as “I understand your point, but you should also consider the following...” You can also respond by refuting facts, logic, etc. Be sure to respond to each opposing argument. Ignoring or dismissing a counterargument shows that your response is weak and unsupported. Participate in a Discussion or Debate LAFS.1112.SL.1.1 When you participate in a collaborative discussion or debate, your goal is to explain, analyze, and defend a point of view. Use the steps below to hold a discussion on this question: Do you think the United States should act as a “global policeman?” Why or why not? To begin, hold a one-on-one discussion with a partner. Then work in a group to delve into the question more deeply. Finally, participate in a teacher-led discussion on this topic. [ 1. ] Prepare. Prepare for the discussion by reading and researching examples and opinions related to the role of the U.S. in the world. In your group, set clear goals and deadlines and establish individual roles, such as lead spokesperson and note keeper. Promote civil, democratic decision decision-making within your group. During the discussion, draw on your preparation by referring to evidence from texts and other research to stimulate a thoughtful, well-reasoned exchange of ideas. Build on others&apos; ideas and express your own clearly and persuasively. [ 2. ] Work with peers to promote civil, democratic discussions. Propel conversations by posing and responding to questions that probe reasoning and evidence; ensure a hearing for a full range of positions on a topic or issue; clarify, verify, or challenge ideas and conclusions; and promote divergent and creative perspectives. Respond thoughtfully to diverse perspectives. [ 3. ] Respond thoughtfully to diverse perspectives. Synthesize comments, claims, and evidence made on all sides of an issue; resolve contradictions when possible; and determine what additional information or research is required to deepen the investigation or complete the task. Give an Effective Presentation LAFS.1112.SL.2.4 When you create a written, visual, and oral presentation, you teach, convince, or share information with an audience. Effective presentations use both words and visuals to engage audiences. Delivery is also important. For example, you can use the way you move, speak, and look at the audience to keep people interested. Use the steps below to prepare and deliver a presentation on key economic indicators. 586 21st Century Skills ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="653"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 1. ] Identify the purpose of your presentation and your audience. Think about the purpose of your written, visual, and oral presentation. If this is a research report, you will need facts and data to support your points. If you are trying to persuade your audience, look for powerful photos. Keep your audience in mind. Consider their interests and present your topic in a way that will engage them. [ 2. ] Write the text and find visual aids for your presentation. Find information and images for your presentation in reliable sources. Organize the information and write it up carefully so that it is easy for your audience to understand. Address alternative or opposing points of view. Photos and diagrams will get people interested in the presentation. So choose large, colorful images that people in the back of the audience will be able to see. [ 3. ] Practice and work to improve your presentation. Keep practicing your oral presentation until you know the material well. Then, practice some more, focusing on improving your delivery. [ 4. ] Use body language, tone of voice, and eye contact to deliver an effective presentation. Answer questions if the audience has them. At the beginning of your oral presentation, take a breath, smile, and stand up tall. Speak more loudly and more clearly than you would in normal conversation. Also, try not to rush through the presentation. Glance at your notes but speak naturally, rather than reading. Look at people in the audience. If people are confused, pause to clarify. Finally, leave time for people in the audience to ask questions. LAFS.1112.WHST.1.2, LAFS.1112.WHST.2.4, Write an Essay LAFS.1112.WHST.2.5 An informative or explanatory essay is one in which the writer conveys or explains facts to his or her audience. An explanation of economic trends, such as the trends during 2016, is one type of informative text. To practice this skill, select a topic related to recent economic history to explain to your fellow classmates. Follow the steps below to write your essay. [ 1. ] Research. Develop the topic by selecting the most significant and relevant facts, extended definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples appropriate to your audience&apos;s knowledge of the topic. [ 2. ] Create an outline. Review all of the information you have gathered and decide how you want to organize your essay. You might order events chronologically, or perhaps you will organize them around an overriding theme. Be sure you address what is most significant for your overall purpose, as well as your audience. Organize complex ideas and information so that each new element builds on that which precedes it to create a unified whole. 21st Century Skills 587 ]]></text>
   </page>
    <page pageNumber="654"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 3. ] Create a first draft. Use varied transitions and sentence structures to link the major sections of the text, create cohesion, and clarify the relationships among complex ideas and concepts. Use language and vocabulary appropriate for discussing economic trends. Try to incorporate techniques such as metaphor, simile, and analogy to manage the complexity of the topic. Include headings, tables, graphs, maps, and multimedia to aid comprehension. Provide a concluding statement or section that follows from and supports the information in your essay. [ 4. ] Revise. Develop and strengthen writing as needed by revising, editing, and rewriting. Try a new approach when necessary. Avoid Plagiarism LAFS.1112.WHST.3.8 When you don&apos;t attribute ideas and information to source materials and authors, you are plagiarizing. Plagiarizing–claiming others&apos; ideas and information as your own–is considered unethical. You can avoid plagiarizing by carefully noting down which authors and sources you&apos;ll be using, citing those authors and sources in your paper, and listing them in a bibliography. To practice this skill, suppose you have been assigned to write a research paper on the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Name three types of sources you might use to help you gather information. Explain how you will avoid plagiarism when you use these sources. [ 1. ] Keep a careful log of your notes. As you read sources to gain background information on your topic, keep track of ideas and information and the sources and authors they come from. Write down the name of each source next to your notes from that particular source so you can remember to cite it later on. Create a separate section in your notes where you keep your own thoughts and ideas so you know which ideas are your own. Using someone else&apos;s words or paraphrasing their ideas does not make them yours. [ 2. ] Cite sources in your paper. You must identify the source materials and authors you use to support your ideas. Whenever you use statistics, facts, direct quotations, or paraphrases of others&apos; views, you need to attribute them to your source. Cite your sources within the body of your paper. Check your assignment to find out how they should be formatted. [ 3. ] List your sources in a bibliography at the end of your paper. List your source materials and authors cited in alphabetical order by author, using accepted formats. As you work, be sure to check your list of sources from your notes so that none are left out of the bibliography. Solve Problems Problem solving is a skill that you use every day. It is a process that requires an open mind, clear thinking, and action. Suppose you found out that, compared to others in your company, you were being underpaid for the work you do. Practice this skill by using these steps to solve the problem of gaining a fair wage for yourself. 588 21st Century Skills ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="655"> <text><![CDATA[ [ 1. ] Understand the problem. Before trying to solve a problem, make sure that you gather as much information as possible in order to identify the problem. What are the causes and effects of the problem? Who is involved? You will want to make sure that you understand different perspectives on the problem. Try not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions. You might end up misunderstanding the problem. [ 2. ] Consider possible solutions and choose the best one. Once you have identified the problem and gathered some information, list and consider a number of possible options. Right away, one solution might seem like the right one, but try to think of other solutions. Be sure to consider carefully the advantages and disadvantages of each option. It can help to take notes listing benefits and drawbacks. Look for the solution whose benefits outweigh its drawbacks. After considering each option, choose the solution you think is best. [ 3. ] Make and implement a plan. Choose and implement a solution. Make a detailed, step-by-step plan to implement the solution that you choose. Write your plan down and assign yourself a deadline for each step. That will help you to stay on track toward completing your plan. Try to think of any problems that might come up and what you will do to address those problems. Of course, there are many things that you cannot predict. Stay flexible. Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution and adjust your plan as necessary. Make Decisions Everyone makes decisions. The trick is to learn how to make good decisions. How can you make good decisions? First, identify a situation that requires a decision and gather information. Then, identify possible options and predict the consequences of each option. Finally, choose the best option and take action to implement a decision. Consider the benefits of getting a job: you gain experience and earn money. The trade-off, or cost, is that you give up time that you could spend studying, playing sports, or just relaxing. Practice this skill by using these steps to decide how to spend your allowance or earnings from a part time job. [ 1. ] Determine the options between which you must decide. In some cases, like ordering from a menu at a restaurant, your options may be clear. In other cases, you will need to identify a situation that requires a decision, gather information, and identify the options that are available to you. Spend some time thinking about the situation and brainstorm a number of options. If necessary, do a little research to find more options. Make a list of options that you might choose.

    <page pageNumber="656"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 2. ] Review the costs and benefits of each option. Carefully predict the consequences of each option. You may want to make a cost-benefit list for each option. To do this, write down the option and then draw two columns underneath it. One column will be the “pro” or benefit list. The other column will be the “con” or cost list. Note the pros and cons for each of your options. Try not to rush through this process. For a very important decision, you may even want to show your list to someone you trust. This person can help you think of costs and benefits that you had not considered. [ 3. ] Determine the best option and act on it. Look through your cost-benefit lists. Note any especially serious costs. If an option has the possibility of an extremely negative consequence, you might want to cross it off your list right away. Look closely at the options with the most benefits and the fewest costs, and choose the one that you think is best. Once you have made a choice, take action to implement a decision. If necessary, make a detailed plan with clear steps. Set a deadline to complete the steps to keep yourself moving toward your goal. Being an Informed Citizen Informed citizens understand the responsibilities, duties, and obligations of citizenship. They are well informed about civic affairs, involved with their communities, and politically active. When it comes to issues they personally care about, they take a stand and reach out to others. [ 1. ] Learn the issues. A great way to begin to understand the responsibilities of citizenship is to first find topics of interest to you. Next, become well informed about civic affairs in your town, city, or country. Read newspapers, magazines, and articles you find online about events happening in your area or around the world. Analyze the information you read to come to your own conclusions. Radio programs, podcasts, and social media are also great ways to keep up with current events and interact with others about issues. [ 2. ] Get involved. Attend community events to speak with others who know the issues. Become well informed about how policies are made and changed. Find out who to speak to if you would like to take part in civic affairs and policy creation. There are government websites that can help direct you to the right person. These websites will also provide his or her contact details. [ 3. ] Take a stand and reach out. Write, call, or meet with your elected officials to become a better informed, more responsible citizen. Do research about candidates who are running for office to be an informed voter. Start your own blog or website to explore issues, interact with others, and be part of the community or national dialogue.

    <page pageNumber="657"> <text><![CDATA[ Political Participation Political participation starts with an understanding of the responsibilities, duties and obligations of citizenship, such as serving the public good. When you understand your role as a political participant, you can get involved through volunteering for a political campaign, running for office, or interacting with others in person or online. [ 1. ] Volunteer for a political campaign. Political campaigns offer a wide variety of opportunities to help you become involved in the political process and become a responsible citizen by serving the public good. As a political campaign volunteer you may have the opportunity to attend events, make calls to voters, and explore your community while getting to know how other voters think about the responsibilities, duties, and obligations of citizenship. [ 2. ] Run for office in your school or community. A good way to become involved in your school or community is to run for office. Student council or community positions offer a great opportunity for you to become familiar with the campaign and election process. [ 3. ] Reach out to others. Start or join an interest group. Interest groups enable people to work together on common goals related to the political process. Write a letter or email to a public official. By contacting an elected official from your area, you can either support or oppose laws or policies. You can also ask for help or support regarding certain issues. [ 4. ] Interact online. Social networking sites and blogs offer a great way for people of all ages to interact and write about political issues. As you connect with others, you&apos;ll become more confident in your role as a citizen working for the public good. Voting Voting is not only a right. It is also one of the primary responsibilities, duties, and obligations of citizenship. Before you can legally vote, however, you must understand the voter registration process and the criteria for voting in elections. You should also understand the issues and know where different candidates stand on those issues. [ 1. ] Check eligibility and residency requirements. In order to vote in the United States, you must be a United States citizen who is 18 years or older, and you must be a resident of the place where you plan to vote. [ 2. ] Register to vote. You cannot vote until you understand the voter registration process. You can register at city or town election offices, or when you get a driver&apos;s license. You can also register by mail or online. You may also have the option of registering at the polls on Election Day, but this does not apply in all states. Make sure to find out what you need to do to register in your state, as well as the deadline for registering. You may have the option of declaring a political party when registering. 21st Century Skills 591 ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="658"> <text><![CDATA[ 21st Century Skills [ 3. ] Learn the issues. As the election approaches, research the candidates and issues in order to be an informed voter. Watch televised debates, if there are any. You can also review the candidates&apos; websites. By doing these things and thinking critically about what you learn, you will be prepared to exercise your responsibility, duty and obligation as a United States citizen. [ 4. ] Vote. Make sure to arrive at the correct polling place on Election Day to cast your ballot. Research to find out when the polls will be open. Advance voting, absentee voting, and voting by mail are also options in certain states for those who qualify. Serving on a Jury As an American, you need to understand the duties, obligations and responsibilities of citizenship; among these is the expectation that you may be required to serve on a jury. You will receive a written notice when you are summoned to jury duty and you&apos;ll receive instruction on the special duties and obligations of a juror. You&apos;ll follow the American code of justice which assumes that a person is innocent until proven guilty, and you&apos;ll follow instructions about keeping trial information confidential. [ 1. ] Wait to receive notification. If you are summoned to serve as a juror, you will be first notified by mail. If you are chosen to move on to the jury selection phase, lawyers from both sides will ask you questions as they select the final jury members. It is an honor to serve as a juror, as it is a responsibility offered only to American citizens. [ 2. ] Follow the law and remain impartial. Your job is to determine whether or not someone broke the law. You may also be asked to sit on the jury for civil cases (as opposed to criminal cases); these cases involve lawsuits filed against individuals or businesses for any perceived wrong doing (such as broken contracts, trespassing, discrimination, etc.). Be sure to follow the law as it is explained to you, regardless of whether you approve of the law or not. Your decision about the trial should not be influenced by any personal bias or views you may have. [ 3. ] Remember that the defendant is presumed innocent. In a criminal trial, the defendant must be proven guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt” for the verdict to be guilty. If the trial team fails to prove the defendant to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury verdict must be “not guilty.” [ 4. ] During the trial, respect the court&apos;s right to privacy. As a juror, you have specific duties, obligations, and responsibilities under the law. Do not permit anyone to talk about the case with you or in your presence, except with the court&apos;s permission. Avoid media coverage once the trial has begun so as to prevent bias. Keep an open mind and do not form or state any opinions about the case until you have heard all of the evidence, the closing arguments from the lawyers, and the judge&apos;s instructions on the applicable law. 592 21st Century Skills ]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="659"> <text><![CDATA[ Paying Taxes Paying taxes is one of the responsibilities of citizenship. How do you go about figuring out how much you&apos;ve already paid in taxes and how much you still owe? It&apos;s your duty and obligation to find out, by determining how much has been deducted from your pay and filing your tax return. [ 1. ] Find out how taxes are deducted from your pay. In the United States, payroll taxes are imposed on employers and employees, and they are collected and paid by the employers. Check your pay stub to find out how much money was deducted for taxes. Be sure to also save the W-2 tax form your employer sends to you. You will need this form later on when filing your tax paperwork. Also save any interest income statements. All this information will help you fulfill your obligation as an American taxpayer. [ 2. ] Check the sales taxes in your state. All but five states impose sales and use taxes on retail sale, lease, and rental of many goods, as well as some services. Sales tax is calculated as the purchase price times the appropriate tax rate. Tax rates vary widely from less than one percent to over ten percent. Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale. [ 3. ] File your tax return. Filing your tax return is more than an obligation: it&apos;s also a duty and responsibility of citizenship. You may receive tax forms in the mail, or pick them up at the local Post Office or library. Fill the forms in and then mail or electronically send completed tax forms and any necessary payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and your state&apos;s department of revenue. The IRS provides free resources to help people prepare and electronically file their tax returns; go to IRS.gov to learn more. Note: certain things such as charitable donations and business expenses are tax deductible. Savvas.com/FloridaSSView Video Tutorials and other 21st Century Skills 21st Century Skills 593 ]]></text>
